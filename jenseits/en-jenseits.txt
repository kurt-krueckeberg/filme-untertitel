Yeah, but not so fast!
Scaredy-cat, come on!
Clarisse, I'm scared!
Come on, get up!
That wasn't so fast.
Look, like this!
Wonderful!
Look, like this!
(Music)
Well, come on! Come on!
(Music)
Huhu!
(Music)
Come on!
Great! Super!
Did you hurt yourself?
(Thunder)
- What's the matter?
- There's a storm outside, Dad.
It's so loud! The thunder goes "Bang! Boom! Boom!" I'm telling you,
all hell's breaking loose out there! - Come on, sleep here! Come on!
Oh, yeah, that must have been very loud.
I can imagine.
No, Dad! It wasn't loud!
Lightning is quiet. Like the moon.
Only the thunder makes noise. It's awfully loud.
Ahhh, the thunder?
What would we do without you and your ears?
(Martin slurps)
Papa, you sound like a fish slithering through the water.
You! You slurp! The phone. It's ringing!
Lara Bischoff. Good morning. Hello, Grandma!
It's Grandma. Your roses are wilting.
Mommy thinks your apartment might be too warm.
You should take asporan... Asporane?
Put aspirin in the water. Are we gonna make it for Christmas?
Are we coming for Christmas?
Yeah, sure we'll be there.
Mm-hm. Yes.
Grandma wants to talk to you.
I don't know if he's still there. I think he's gone.
I have to go to school. Mom, come! Yes, Grandma. Yes, Grandma.
Bye!
(Music)
- Good morning, Santa Claus.
- Good morning, Santa.
(Music)
Dad! You wanted to enlarge the poster for the school party for me!
- Good morning, Santa!
- Morning, Lara.
- I'm on my way. - Lara. Hey, how are you?
- Good.
I'm not sure if Martin knows that there's no Christmas bonus this year.
Is that a bad thing?
Well... Will you tell him? - If it's something bad, you'd better tell him yourself.
I have to go to school. I have to go to school. Bye.
(This is where he thought...
probably the Schatzhauser lives here. (The children laugh gleefully)
- Zog ... be ...
- Lara, that was homework!
Didn't you practice?
- Maybe you didn't have time to practice?
- Maybe she read it to her dad...
and he loved it. - It doesn't help, Lara.
Reading is important.
If you don't do anything at home, you'll just have to stay late.
Do you understand?
- Keep reading, Uli. But with feeling.
- With feeling? With feeling?
As he spoke, he saw, to his horror...
(He felt as if he had thrown the glass...
How much longer is this going to take?
We have an appointment at the bank.
We have an appointment at the bank.
Not now! We have reading to do. That's important!
Yes, yes, just do it properly, the reading!
I'm so proud of you.
What is it, Mama?
I'm waiting.
(What's so interesting out there? Hm? Bea! What's so funny?
- Lara's mother is outside.
- Again?
That was really the last time! Next time I'll make you wait in the playground...
until you're black!
Life is school, not the other way around? Yeah, great!
Explain that to my teacher!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do anything about that until March 1st. Tell them..,
Tell them they're committed for six months... And that the return isn't due until then.
Ask him what about the money we put in...
can't he give us any of it back?
We need money now!
We can't, Dad!
Stop begging!
Ask him!
My father thanks you. He's pleased with your business.
I'm glad.
He says no.
You didn't ask him!
- Is there anything else I can do to help your parents?
- No, thank you.
Yeah, that's right. If I say it can't be done, it can't be done. Shall we go? - Thank you, Lara.
My parents are the customers, not me. - Thank you very much.
You're supposed to fucking translate what I tell you!
- I did!
- Would you like another candy?
(In speaking...
saying those words...
No, I don't hear anything yet.
...he saw...
his great horror ...
(Music from the radio)
Now, Dad, now what comes! That's nice! Music!
Leave it on!
Yes, yes. I'll read on.
(Behind the thick ...
Fir ...
Huhu! Grandma! Grandpa! We're here!
(Hello, angel! Merry Christmas, Grandma.
Merry Christmas.
I don't really remember what she looks like... But I remember what she smells like:
Lily of the valley and summer. - Who does, my dear?
Clarissa! My God, when will they come?
Robert must be on the blink again.
Oh, angel, I envy you so. You speak that magic language
as if it were child's play. If I hadn't listened to that pig-headed man..,
...my hands might be... ...fly.
Will you help me set the table?
- Hello, Clarissa! Hello, Uncle Gregor!
- My darling!
- Merry Christmas, you two! I'm glad you're here.
- I'm just here for the goose.
- We're having roast goose, aren't we?
- Stop, come on, they're going in the living room.
Huh? Oh! See, I thought they'd go on the roof! - How's it been so far?
Peaceful. And I'd like it to stay that way.
- I'd like it to stay that way. It's Christmas.
- Yeah, it is.
Can you tell me why you're so late?
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- Merry Christmas.
Martin.
Boo! It's freezing cold out there!
And I left my blanket in heaven.
Zapperlot, what do I see? They're nothing but old people!
Aren't there any... any... what do you call those little...
children in this abandoned house? Well, you naughty thing?
I know who you are! You're not Santa Claus at all!
What? You say that, you get nothing. Who am I?
Who am I? Who am I?
Uncle Gre... No, you're not. Santa Claus.
Good girl. Well, then, this is all...
...for you. All of it!
You like it?
I didn't know what to buy...
Go on, take it! I know you can use it.
- Who gave you that beautiful book? - From dad.
- Lara? Are you coming?
Yes, Grandma.
We'll read it later.
(Shall we play a game, the two of us? - Okay, but no Christmas carols.
- Okay, last year's song.
- What should I do, Grandma?
You can pick up the napkins, okay?
(Music)
I thought we'd look at the book?
Wait! Clarissa is playing something.
Use your hands when you talk to me!
(Beautiful, you two! (They deserve the beautiful music.
Bravo.
Tell me, Lara. Do you tell the baby stories now and then? Voices and sounds are very important
- are very important for unborn children.
- Is that right, Grandma?
Mm-hmm. That's right.
- Say, maybe you'd like to spend the night?
- Oh, yes! Please, please!
- You'll be driving at least an hour in this weather! Hmm?
- Come with me.
Don't cheat!
- Here. This is for you!
- What's that?
- Whoa!
- That's my first one! I learned to play on it.
- Do you want it?
- Thanks, Clarissa!
Look.
The lower lip is important. You have to press it flat over your teeth. There, look!
- Say, you're quite a talent! (Lara? Lara!
Where are you?
- Your parents want to drive!
- Oh. I have to go down!
Stay a little longer. I'll drive you home tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.
Go on. Ask her.
Clarissa wants me to stay a little longer. Can I?
She's driving me home tomorrow. Yes?
(It needs little to be happy..,
for he who is happy...
is a king.
(They sing together in canon)
Look! This is my favorite color! Try it.
Mum never wears make-up.
When I was as little as you, I had much shorter hair. Like this.
- Want me to cut it? - No, I'll cut it.
- That would be nice.
It's okay, it's okay. I won't do anything you don't want.
See that?
That's the haircut I used to have.
- Is that Dad?
- Yes, it's Dad.
That's all of us about 20 years ago! Look, the granny.
- You didn't like him.
- Who do you mean? Martin?
Did he say that?
That's not true. When we were little, we were very close.
And then? Well, you know your father.
You know how stubborn he can be.
Your grandma, she always protected him. With her he was allowed everything!
On his 15th birthday, he threw all the china off the coffee table.
Imagine, everything broken.
And Grandma didn't even bat an eyelid. He was always her favorite.
- Me, I didn't stand a chance.
- But you never learned his language.
Yes, I did a little. When we were little..,
we used to make up our own imaginary signs.
But the doctors said that was a mistake.
That sign language was keeping him from learning to talk.
Allegedly.
You look beautiful in that dress.
What's up?
Should I take it off?
Don't worry. I'll make you beautiful. I'll make you beautiful!
(Melancholic music)
We had said in the afternoon!
How do you look?
Why are you crying?
Now you look like her...
...isn't that what you wanted?
We're stuck!
Hey, Dad! Let go, Dad!
Hey! Let go, Dad!
(music from recorder)
Mommy? Why can't you ride a bike?
You don't have a good sense of balance because of your ears?
I wish you'd learn. All real mothers
can ride a bike!
When the baby comes. Promise?
Boo... Listen, you in there. You don't have to be afraid.
It's not completely quiet out here. When you come, I'll be here,
and I'll play you something on my new clarinet.
(One, two, three!
(Children's song: "The Cockoo and the Donkey")
(The children play wrong)
Ow!
How often do I have to say it: The cellos are always too high!
- Mr. Gardener!
- Not now, we're in the middle of rehearsal. We're in the middle of rehearsal!
- And the flutes don't listen to each other!
- Mrs. Mertens sent me down.
- I play the clarinet.
- Can you read music?
She can't even read books!
Come here. Come on.
What is not, can still be.
I don't give up hope that you'll remember...
that you'll remember the two triangle stakes by parents' evening.
(C... D... F... G.
(Plays the scale)
Like this. Wonderful. Now hold the last note.
Great, and now the whole thing from the beginning: Der Gute Claus darf Fr√ºher Gehen.
I didn't want to learn poetry.
(Lara plays the scale)
My homework? I have nothing on.
I'm not lazy! And I've already gotten better, says Mrs. Mertens.
Papa! What are you doing? Give me back my clarinet!
What? The music distracts me from studying? Nonsense!
Studying isn't more important!
What do you know about what's important?
You're deaf. You don't even know what music is.
Boah! You're mean! You never cared about my school!
You don't and Mommy doesn't! You just don't want
that I know how to play the clarinet. I hate you!
I'm going to lose it
Only if you make the same mistake...
...like your parents did.
What do you mean?
You have to take her as she is.
Hearing.
We're deaf.
She's my child.
But she's not yours.
(bells ringing)
(church organ)
Praise the Lord, mighty King of Glory.
My beloved soul,
this is my desire.
Come to me,
Psaltery and harp, awake.
Let the song of praise be heard.
Praise the Lord, who rules all things so gloriously.
[Shouting]
Who keeps you safe on Adeler's wing...
Mama! Mama!
What's the matter?
So much longer? Yes, I still want to wait.
I'll stay here with you until the baby comes.
Yes, they make a noise. They sound like bells.
The more wind, the louder they ring.
Boo!
Were you happy when Clarissa was born?
First... and then?
Didn't you ever play together when you were my age?
Why?
When Clarissa was 9 or 10, she gave her first concert...
in front of a big audience.
Grandpa invited a lot of important people.
I think it was his 50th birthday.
Everyone was very excited that day.
Clarissa had to play a few pieces on the clarinet.
She practiced for a long time.
And Grandpa was very, very proud of his daughter.
Shh!
(Robert, Robert, let him be!
Mum! Mom!
From that night on, Clarissa never wanted to play when I was in the room.
So I spent many evenings alone in the nursery.
Lara! Lara!
I got it from a friend who teaches at the high school.
It's still a bit demanding, but give it a try.
We haven't had any pieces with triplets yet. When you get to this part,
- you just count quietly: "1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3!" - That fast?
- As fast as you can,
- As fast as you can. I thought since everything was in G major...
- So this is an F sharp.
Hm.
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...
Next year we'll look for a private teacher for you.
Should I discuss it with your parents?
I'd rather not. They're pretty busy with our baby right now.
Are you going to Uli's birthday party?
- Why not?
- Because he didn't invite me.
Don't be sad, Lara. Ravens fly in flocks.
But the eagle flies alone.
Don't complain, it's time you did.
You want to look beautiful, don't you? Yes.
Hey, Mom! Don't!
Don't, Mama!
I'm supposed to read her a story.
I'm supposed to talk to her a lot!
Oh yeah? How do you know she's tired?
Did she tell you that?
Yes.
Marie? Did you hear that? Marie! Marie!
Do you hear that? Marie! Marie!
Do you hear me? Marie!
(Marie cries)
Hey, you can hear!
She can hear! She can hear! Marie, you can hear. You can hear, Marie.
Everything you said sounds so beautiful.
Yes, and? What's bothering you?
No, no, everything's different. I'm not like I used to be.
But you must know one thing, Maria! You do love me.
- You know you love me.
- Yes, yes!
Look at me, Maria! We have our whole lives ahead of us.
You and I.
Nothing can separate us now.
From now on, we'll always be together.
Yes.
(Lara!
A bike ride? But I think you can not, Mom?
(Music, Laughter)
(Music)
(Honk)
Mom!
So, except for the triangle inserts, everything was quite nice.
- I'm just not so musical.
- Oh, you don't say!
And maybe next time the trumpet will take out the chewing gum!
Nice of you to come. Lara's a wonderful student,
but please understand my concern. She can't possibly transfer
if she doesn't get better at reading and writing.
My reading is improving...
...but it's still not perfect.
Yes, and besides, she can't keep dropping out of class early.
Tell her we're glad she lets you leave early once in a while...
Are we almost there?
...it's hard to find a good interpreter here.
It's summer vacation soon, so I won't have to leave class early.
But tell them that this is really my last word.
Next time I just won't let you go.
You're a wonderful teacher. Lara really likes you.
She thinks you're quite nice.
- How nice. Thank you.
- Finally, I get to see you!
Your daughter really is an extraordinary talent.
I'll reserve you two front-row tickets to the parents' evening. Do you mind?
This is my music teacher.
He thinks it's a shame
He thinks it's a shame you never let me play the clarinet.
We have to pick up the baby now. Are there any questions?
- Lara, are you sure you told them all my concerns?
- I told them everything.
Not word for word, but pretty much.
The easiest note is the G! No fingers, look!
It's never happened before. Maybe they never use it,
because it's so easy.
Mm-hm. I did my math on the bus. I have to read a story,
but I can do that tomorrow.
Are you coming tomorrow?
Sure, the baby ...
(Music)
The sun sounds in the old way in the brother sphere chant
and its prescribed journey
is completed with the sound of thunder!
The sight of her gives the angels strength... strength,
(...when none may... when no one may proclaim you.
The incredibly great works are glorious as the first day!
It's your turn now. Are you all right?
You're doing fine! You're doing very, very well! Huh?
(And now Lara Bischoff from Class 3c...
She'll play a piece for us on the clarinet.
(Applause)
(Silent)
It's the best! Absolutely.
Students come from all over the world.
Why don't you say something? Lara's future is at stake.
So you're trying to take away the only talented student I've ever had.
- I'm not sure I find that funny.
- She's gotta do something with her talent.
- She can't become anything here.
- She's got a point!
I don't know. I'd have to get a room. I'd have to get a room. It's too expensive.
- There's a way.
- You don't believe yourself,
- that dad takes money from you.
- I don't want to give it to him, but to you!
- Can I write you some kind of recommendation?
- Music isn't that important to me.
If you don't accept the offer, you're missing a huge opportunity!
Besides, you can't spend your life taking care of your parents.
Oh, Clarisse!
You show up every lunar year with a different idea every time!
- Sometimes I think you're just bored!
- Yes, exactly! And that's why I'm going to make you...
a last offer. You come to us over the summer and we'll rehearse
a few pieces together. Every day. All summer long, just playing and going to concerts.
And then we'll see if it's enough for the entrance exam. Do you want to?
- Can I come along?
- You know I want to.
You don't know how bored I am with your uncle all day.
Look!
(Music of the 60s)
(Melancholic music)
What's wrong with Marie? Can't she make a phone call for you?
Ok, I'm coming.
I was drinking. With a few friends.
Yeah, sure. I'll bring her by sometime.
Mom wants me to make some calls.
(Melancholic music)
See this beautiful night?
Take a good look...
Things are changing fast.
Soon it will be spring...
the snow will melt.
What does the snow sound like?
What does it say to you?
It says, "Crunch, crunch! Whoa, whoa..."
What's that? "Crunch" and "brr"?
What kind of weird words are those?
Well, honestly, snow doesn't say much.
In fact, they say that snow swallows up all sound.
When there's snow, everything is much quieter.
Really?
Snow makes the world go quiet?
That's nice.
Clarissa was at school today.
I didn't know she was here either.
Her birthday's coming up. Grandpa wants to take us all out to dinner.
Please! Come with me, Papa. For my sake.
- Ew. You pig.
- It's just chocolate.
- Before dinner?
- Bettina threw a round.
- Hi! - Hi.
- Bettina's sleeping over.
Her parents are away. Can we borrow your clarinet?
- No way!
- Why not? Afraid I'll break it?
- Have you set the table yet?
- I just want to show it to Bettina! Please!
Stop it! You're not getting it, okay? If you're bored, help mommy in the kitchen.
I don't want it, your stupid horn! It gets on everyone's nerves anyway, your music!
You hear that? It's like this all day long!
I'm sick to death of this drone. Ah!
Shh, come on!
(Come on.
Ouch, Mom. Ouch, ouch! Help!
Ouch! Ouch!
Nothing. Louder, come on, hurry up!
Ouch! Ouch, mom! Ouch! Help! Ouch!
Ouch, mama! Ouch! Ouch, help!
Marie! Did you hurt yourself? (The girls giggle)
What's this crap?
Bettina thinks that maybe our parents are not really deaf.
She thinks that maybe they are spies that someone has sent to monitor us!
- We just tested Mom!
- Have you gone completely crazy?
- Hey! - Aren't you ashamed?
- Nope, why?
Lara!
She thinks it's funny. When she was a child.
she always imagined strange things.
See, she didn't think it was so bad! Only you have to get so upset again!
- Go back to playing your stupid clarinet!
- Be glad that you have ears
to hear it, my stupid clarinet. - Dad can't hear anything, and he hates it anyway,
your music! - I can move out if you all don't like it.
Then you'll look stupid!
(How's work with the kids?
I think I'll stop teaching again. (But little Keller...
- But little Keller has made wonderful progress with you.
- Julia moved to Frankfurt with her parents.
and the others aren't really interested.
- It's boring.
- What do you say to that? Gregor!
Me? Uh... yes, of course she has talents.
The kids are crazy about her.
But if she doesn't feel like it...
You can't live your whole life on the pleasure principle!
You have to do something. Or are you just going to spend your husband's money?
Well, that's not fair. I've always earned my own money. - You have? What did you do?
I'm sorry if I haven't lived up to your expectations, Dad.
Money is really not the point. (Now stop all this arguing!
(The sugar, please, Lilly. (It's Clarissa's birthday!
It's Christmas! It's Clarissa's birthday!
It's not my fault we only see each other...
on these stupid holidays! - But we don't have to talk about the same things...
about the same topics every time. (What else can we talk about?
Talk? I'd call that a put-down.
(Excuse me, can we have the cake quickly? (Yes, right away!
(But we've been through this.
If you had children, a family... I wonder what you do all day?
- Cleaning!
- Yes, that's it. Cleaning.
Cleaning, like this.
Well, she'll have enough to do in the summer, when Lara lives with us.
Marie! (Father) What? Lara is moving in with you?
What? You haven't told them yet?
You haven't told them yet? I thought we had discussed it.
What are you talking about? Don't keep me in suspense!
What's with all the secrecy? (Happy birthday to you!
What hasn't Lara told you?
I'd rather tell them myself, Clarissa.
You don't dare anyway. Lara will stay with us for the summer...
I'll prepare her for the exams, and if all goes well...
she'll go to the conservatory.
(To Berlin? Isn't there anything a bit closer?
(I think it's a good idea. Lara's talent should be encouraged.
Maybe she'll make something of it. (But Berlin is so far away!
Then you must really live there. Do you want to move out?
Lara is 18 years old! There comes a time for everyone.
If Martin and Kai have something against it, then of course it won't work.
Do you always have to stab me in the back?
I stab you in the back? I'm lucky..,
I'm lucky if I get a word in edgewise.
Martin. Leave her alone. She's a wonderful clarinetist!
- And I want her to be promoted!
- We'll take care of the finances!
- Don't worry about that.
- She needs to get out of this nest.
She's taken care of you long enough.
(Please, Clarissa! For God's sake, cut it out!
Why? School is just what she needs.
Besides, you can visit her during that time.
But we wanted to go to Italy in the summer! All together!
Yes, but this is more important. Martin and Kai must finally understand.
Lara doesn't have to live the life of a handicapped person..,
- just because her parents are handicapped.
- I'm the father.
She's my daughter!
Martin, sit down!
- Clarissa, you've really gone too far.
- Yes, exactly. Now it's my fault again.
He throws red wine in my face and you defend him. Shit!
I wanted to tell you tonight. Clarissa was just faster!
Nothing's been decided yet! Clarissa just wants me
for the entrance exam, that's all! She just wants to help me.
She doesn't think she's doing anything. That's nonsense.
Do you think you and Mom can get along without me?
I'll treat you like a baby.
I don't want to run away!
Yeah, if that's not what this is about... What is it about?
I ruined their evening again...
They were ashamed of me.
As usual.
So what? It doesn't matter.
Why did you have to go to Clarissa's?
Can't you imagine how it hurts me?
But I want to be a musician, nothing else.
Don't you understand?
Sometimes I wish you were deaf too...
...so you could be in my world.
I think it's really mean that you're driving! Now I have to translate all those love stories
for Mom! Don't be a jerk,
You don't help enough anyway.
Can I at least sleep in your bed?
Can I at least sleep in your bed while you're away? If it pleases you.
Yes, I will! And don't pack Romy!
Why do parents always talk about schoolwork?
(Stomps on)
When I was little, I firmly believed that all people, when they grow up,
...they could sing. I thought that when I grew up, I could do it too.
I used to stand in front of a mirror and move my mouth...
...and imagined beautiful sounds coming out of it...
Sounds that make people look so ecstatic, so happy.
Music.
I used to dance in front of the mirror and hold my brush in front of my mouth,
as a microphone.
What's that, Mama?
You're not sure I like this music.
It's a clarinet concerto. You read about it in the paper.
Sure I did! I'm sure it's very good!
But why two tickets?
Yes, we'll have a nice evening together. I think it would be wonderful..,
if you came with me.
(stomps on floor)
Thank you. I'm glad you came.
- It's nice that you're here.
- Why didn't Clarissa
Why didn't Clarissa come to the station? - She's not feeling well this morning. - Oh!
Nothing serious. She's usually better after sunset.
- Do you know what time it is?
- Lara! There you are at last!
Come on, let's go! Come on, get up! I want to see the city! - You want to see the city?
Yes, now you've dragged me all the way here,
- now I want to see the city too!
- See the city. Do you know how big the city is?
(music)
(Music)
(Walter) Hey, Clarissa!
This is Lara, my niece. Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang ...
Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter. Hello.
- Are you visiting Berlin?
- She wants to go to the conservatory. But we have to get her used
to get her used to the big city. Hello.
- So you're a musician?
- Not yet.
- She plays the clarinet and she's very good at it!
- And now you want to see Berlin?
(Unintelligible conversation)
(Unintelligible)
(Drums start)
Lara, come!
Come! Yes, come!
We have already played! We start together.
Wonderful!
You, go on!
(Applause)
(Laughter)
- This is my lake.
- Wow. And in the middle of the city!
The only place that makes me a little nostalgic.
It always makes me think of home. It even froze over last winter.
If someone comes now!
(Melancholic clarinet music)
And?
I don't like this melancholic stuff. It spoils the mood
for the whole day. Don't worry. I'll pick out some nice tunes for you.
I don't know if I want to play anything else. I like the music.
But you won't make it with that.
- Says who?
- Says me.
You wanna depress the commission to death?
- I think they should admit you!
- Clarissa, that's complete nonsense.
- The greatest composers...
- Either you believe me,
or you can try it alone.
Gregor!
You could really listen just once! - Me? Come on, this is ridiculous!
You're so full of shit!
Asshole!
(Conversations in the background)
(Music)
(Music)
Stupid, if you're so stared at, right?
I've been watching you.
I noticed it ...
Hello! I'm Johanna. Who are you?
L-a-r-a
T-o-m
Actually we wanted to go to the park...
but I'm allowed to look here for a moment!
Right, right, right. And "quick" is just about up.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, we want those gloves.
- Aren't you deaf?
- Me? No. You?
Prego. - How much is it? 5.80. What do you want, kid?
- This?
- My father is deaf.
- He raised me alone.
- Ciao, thanks!
And now I'm a teacher at a school for the deaf.
Actually, we should practice articulation today. What about you?
- How come you're so good at sign language?
- I'm the same way with parents.
Watch out, it's slippery here!
- I'm taking Johanna home. Are you coming?
- I'LL BE GONE IN TWO MONTHS ANYWAY.
I'll be gone in two months anyway. I'm going to Washington for a semester.
Gallaudet School. It's a deaf-only university. They study everything there.
Medicine, art history, law. All in sign language.
The Americans have long since recognized it as a full-fledged language.
They're 20 years ahead of us. - I always wanted to have a father..,
I could be proud of. One who would defend me against the world
and sing me songs at bedtime. - One who can't understand..,
- what you like better about Guns 'n' Roses than Beethoven.
- Exactly.
- 6:30. I gotta get home.
- What? 6:30 already? That's so late.
Will you come and see me at school? I'm there every day.
Maybe.
Hey!
I thought I'd visit you.
It's Lara! She came to visit!
Maybe she wants to be a teacher!
Lie down!
- What do you want me to do?
- Lie down on the floor!
On your belly! (rock music)
- Or don't you want to join in?
- Yes, I do.
Just wait! Eyes closed. (Turns up the music)
Poor Lara. I think she can't feel music!
Hey! Are you going to the movies with me tomorrow?
Clarissa?
Lara, come in! Come on!
It's wonderful, the water. Ah!
- I didn't bring my swimsuit!
- So what? You're a bore! Come in!
Come on!
Aren't you scared here? In the middle of the night?
First one to the buoy!
Where did Gregor go?
- He's looking for an apartment.
- He's looking for an apartment.
He says my music gives him a toothache.
They're all against us. All of them!
(laughter)
- Clarissa?
- Huh?
Why don't you have a baby? Gregor and you?
I don't know whose fault it is. It never worked out.
Maybe nature doesn't want a baby to have a mother like me.
I did it all wrong.
Martin has you, Kai and Marie. A real home.
I don't have anything.
That's not true. Clarissa, you have so much.
You're beautiful and strong, and you make wonderful music.
I've always wanted to be like you.
Beautiful, isn't it? Wasn't it? You didn't like it?
- Somehow movies like that make me sad.
- Sad? Love stories with happy endings
- make you sad?
- Yes, they do. They make me dissatisfied...
- with what I have. I mean, they give you so much hope.
- Hope?
- Oh, yes, a common evil.
- You have to be careful with your dreams.
- Most of them don't come true anyway.
Hey, why are you so serious? You're not even 20
- and you talk like Mrs. Kowalschek.
- Who's that?
My caretaker. But she's 70, fat and ugly! Hangs around the window all day
with the poodle and the pillow at the window. Don't you have anything nice in your life?
Not much.
You're driving me crazy, you ungrateful thing!
- Don't feel so sorry for yourself!
- I'm hungry.
Go on. Giddyup! Hey!
- Here! Let's get some schnitzel!
- What, schnitzel?
- Hello! Two schnitzels, please.
- I don't have any money!
It's on me.
- A schnitzel with ketchup for you?
- Oh no. Thank you.
(Song: I WILL SURVIVE)
That's Gloria Gaynor. I loved this when I was 14.
Lara.
Come here to me.
Come here to me, my girl.
Your mother had an accident last night, on her bike.
She's dead.
(Lara cries)
(Melancholic Music)
(Melancholic music)
(Cries)
No sound, Papa. She does it silently.
She should never have learned to ride a bike. That was a mistake.
She had trouble with her balance.
Are you saying it's my fault?
Hey, look at me! Talk to me, damn it.
You don't believe that!
What do you want me to do?
The music bothers you.
You don't want music in your house. In your house?
I'm sure it won't be later than 11:00 if the bus is on time. You okay?
- Do you have to go?
- Yeah, I have to go. I haven't been out in months.
And I'm on the verge of going insane...
Besides, the tickets are from Mom.
Why can't I go?
- You have two!
- One has to stay with Dad.
- You have to put him to bed.
- Let him put himself to bed.
- I'm not his babysitter.
- So, careful, missy. Don't be cheeky!
- How do I look? How do I look?
- Too colorful.
- Really? Clarissa wears make-up like that too.
- Clarissa looks good too.
I love you so much. You know that, right?
(Listen to the sound of the picture!)
Listen, the sound of the picture!
Can you hear it?
He's a great artist: Chagall.
He knows, that el mundo is music.
- You want to know the truth of music?
- Yes. I want to learn it.
Learn? You don't need it! You have it inside!
Listen to the song inside.
(Spanish) Giora, prisa! El concierto va a comenzar.
(Applause)
(Plays a melancholy tune)
(South American melody)
(South American melody)
(South American melody)
(Melancholic melody)
Tom?
What are you doing here?
You passed me on the bus earlier.
I wanted to see how you are.
Your aunt told me that ... I'm flying tomorrow night.
Lara, I'm so sorry.
I just heard a beautiful concert.
I want to go to that school so bad! I have to get into that school.
- Do you think I'm good enough?
- I've never heard you play.
- Do you want me to play for you? Now?
- Now?
Why not?
There must be some advantage to our fathers being deaf.
- You're in a good mood again.
- Shh! My sister hears even better!
- Don't you need a light for the notes?
- It's all in my head!
So, cut me some slack! I just made it up!
(Plays a melancholic tune)
(Melancholic music)
(Romantic music)
(Romantic music)
(Romantic music)
Did you know that bees are deaf?
Really, teacher?
But they can sense sounds through their sense of touch.
Now she hears your heart beating.
Can't I stay at your place? I have to prepare for the exam somewhere.
- And I want to get out of here.
- I've already rented it to a friend for the semester.
I'm renting it to a friend for the semester. I can't leave him hanging.
Hey!
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so sad, little Lara?
The saddest things in life are breakups and death.
I don't want to say goodbye anymore. I've had enough of it.
Oh! You're not rid of me yet. Our story's just beginning.
And we make a pretty good couple, a clarinetist...
A clarinetist and a teacher of the deaf. It's a great match.
- I don't want you to leave.
- I'm almost back.
- Where did you come from?
- I went for a walk...
- Aren't you a bit late?
- What time is it? It's only 7:15.
- Did you enjoy the concert? - Mm
-hm.
So-so. Around 12, I think.
So what? I wasn't there at 11:00. I'm 18 years old.
I'm allowed to be an hour late.
You can do some things, but not everything? What's wrong now?
First of all, he doesn't like it when you bring men home...
and with them in the living room... Who was there?
Well, what? What did I do wrong again, Dad? What else are you going to accuse me of?
That I'm irresponsible? That I'm selfish?
That I only think about myself and my music? That I stabbed you and Mom in the back?
That I took Clarissa's side? Want me to tell you something?
I can't stand her anymore. Your reproachful silent looks...
Your complaints. I can't stand the silence in this house..,
the noises you make when you read the paper, when you eat..,
when you brush your teeth. This house has become like a cage.
- Lara! Why are you saying all this?
- I've had enough!
Yes?
I'm looking for my aunt, Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here?
Lara! What are you doing here? Come in!
Walter is a photographer!
He's going to Spain to take pictures for a travel magazine!
He thinks I can help him.
As his assistant, so to speak. We're leaving next week.
And Gregor? And Gregor?
Your uncle has chosen to live alone.
You did the right thing, Lara. Your music is more important now.
Martin will understand.
But that's typical of him:
He behaves like a madman and we have the guilty conscience.
You have no idea what's going on in his head.
- What's going on now?
- You have no right
You have no right to judge him. You never bothered to get to know him in the first place.
- Lara, I just want you to get out of there...
What is it you want from me, Clarissa?
Sometimes I think you just want to win. You want me to go to...
- to go to that school. For whatever reason.
- Oh, nonsense. I want you to be good. Really good.
All your personal problems
are distracting you from your music! - Yeah, you want me to be good.
I am good. But not better than you. - That's not fair.
And that's why you're so against my music. You think it's boring, depressing.
If you were really interested in me, you would have supported me..,
...what I wanted. You never did. - Oh, ladies! You're not going to get into a fight
...to get in each other's hair! - Shut the fuck up!
You don't know what we're talking about! - Coffee?
- Just like your father. That's great. Now I finally see you for who you are.
- That's right. You're my father.
I'm my father's child. And I'm not the daughter
you never had! And above all, I'm not you!
That's my publishing house over there.
You sleep here.
I'll sleep downstairs.
I'm due next month. My publisher's getting impatient!
- I only play when you're not here.
- You can play whenever you want.
After 12 years with your aunt, I can sleep through any noise.
- Gregor?
- Are you sorry you moved out?
Do you regret moving out?
Not really.
But it can still happen.
Then why did you leave?
There's no place for me in Clarissa's head.
- There's you and Robert and Martin.
- But they're always fighting.
Still... I wish she'd ever loved me like that.
Besides, she eats such a damn healthy diet! That got on my nerves.
Everything in her fridge is green. I don't eat anything
that's green. Except chewing gum!
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(music)
(phone)
Yes? Ah, Marie! Hello! Where are you?
- Am very close! In the middle of town.
Can you pick me up? I don't know which subway
which subway to take.
- Are you alone?
Yes.
Oh, my God!
Lara!
Are you out of your mind? Alone on the train!
What are you doing here?
- To visit you.
You came 500 km by train for that? I don't have any time!
Does Dad know you're here?
- Of course he does. I left him a note.
A note? What did it say?
- That I was going to a party
after school. It said the party was 500 kilometers away,
I didn't write it down.
What did he say?
- What's he saying?
You know. Is he talking about me?
M-m. I didn't think it was so nice, what you said.
Shut up. You don't have to say that to me now.
Can you come back soon, please?
The exam is in four days.
- How am I supposed to get home?
Why, don't you have a return ticket?
- I ran out of money.
I ran out of money. And it's almost night.
And I'm only 9!
Oh, shit.
(There's a problem sleeping right in front of me.
Come here, you'll see it. We need your help.
Yeah. Family thing!
The tank's full. I filled it up yesterday.
I filled it up yesterday.
You all right?
I'm fine.
What's he doing, 220?
- Be careful driving.
See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
Take care, Marie. Say hello to Martin from me!
(Music)
Other fathers are proud of their daughters ...
when they succeed.
Why don't you help me?
You can't send me in there alone.
Dad'll tear me apart.
- I drove you all the way.
You'll have to walk the last 10 yards yourself.
Please.
Go on. He'll be glad you're back.
I drove Marie home.
I drove Marie home.
Hey! Since when does Clarissa know our language?
Is Lara still with you?
Is she okay?
No. She's not okay. She misses you.
Come on, I'll take you to her.
Why didn't she come?
Because she doesn't have time! You have to come to her!
Ow, yeah! We'll go right back! All together, yes?
No, we can't.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
It must be a family problem...
Oh man, Dad. Why didn't you come?
And if you run off again...
I'll kick your ass!
(alarm clock rings)
(Silent)
What instrument?
- Clarinet.
Good luck!
- Thank you.
Lara Bischoff? Come in, please.
[Silent]
Miss Bischoff, in your documents..,
that you're interested in traditional klezmer music.
What interests you in this musical genre?
- It's hard to say.
It's such a feeling. Maybe because it's so emotional.
Emotional? Well...
- I mean, she's...
She's happy and wild at heart, and at the same time she's...
sad and not really free. And that connection,
I can understand it. You know what I mean?
Then let's start with the main subject.
Miss Bischoff, you brought us three pieces?
- Yes. If you don't mind,
I'll start with the contemporary piece?
- As you wish.
We don't care about the order.
I want to see you play, is that all right?
Miss Bishop, we're waiting.
Are you all right? Would you like some water?
Take a deep breath. Let's go. It's not so bad.
It's okay.
I just want to keep my fingers crossed for you.
What are you doing, Dad? Why did you come?
I wanted to see what's so important to you...
and I want to see how you play.
Excuse me, but would you mind letting us in on this?
Yes. It's my father! He's deaf. He'd like to watch.
Well, if he wants to, but... I really must ask you now.
That's it, show them!
Please, Dad. Don't say any more! You're getting me all mixed up.
So that's it, your music?
Yes. That's my music. Do you think you'll ever understand it?
I may not be able to hear it...
...but I'll try to "understand" it!
Did I...
...lost you?
I've loved you since the day I was born.
You'll never lose me.
Thanks for coming.
