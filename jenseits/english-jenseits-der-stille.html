<div id="grid-col"><p>Yeah, but not so fast!</p>
<p>Scaredy-cat, come on!</p>
<p>Clarisse, I'm scared!</p>
<p>Come on, get up!</p>
<p>That wasn't so fast.</p>
<p>Look, like this!</p>
<p>Wonderful!</p>
<p>Look, like this!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Well, come on! Come on!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Huhu!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Great! Super!</p>
<p>Did you hurt yourself?</p>
<p>(Thunder)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's the matter?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>There's a storm outside, Dad.</p>
<p>It's so loud! The thunder goes "Bang! Boom! Boom!" I'm telling you,</p>
<p>all hell's breaking loose out there! - Come on, sleep here! Come on!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that must have been very loud.</p>
<p>I can imagine.</p>
<p>No, Dad! It wasn't loud!</p>
<p>Lightning is quiet. Like the moon.</p>
<p>Only the thunder makes noise. It's awfully loud.</p>
<p>Ahhh, the thunder?</p>
<p>What would we do without you and your ears?</p>
<p>(Martin slurps)</p>
<p>Papa, you sound like a fish slithering through the water.</p>
<p>You! You slurp! The phone. It's ringing!</p>
<p>Lara Bischoff. Good morning. Hello, Grandma!</p>
<p>It's Grandma. Your roses are wilting.</p>
<p>Mommy thinks your apartment might be too warm.</p>
<p>You should take asporan... Asporane?</p>
<p>Put aspirin in the water. Are we gonna make it for Christmas?</p>
<p>Are we coming for Christmas?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure we'll be there.</p>
<p>Mm-hm. Yes.</p>
<p>Grandma wants to talk to you.</p>
<p>I don't know if he's still there. I think he's gone.</p>
<p>I have to go to school. Mom, come! Yes, Grandma. Yes, Grandma.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Santa Claus.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Santa.</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Dad! You wanted to enlarge the poster for the school party for me!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Santa!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Morning, Lara.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm on my way. - Lara. Hey, how are you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if Martin knows that there's no Christmas bonus this year.</p>
<p>Is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Well... Will you tell him? - If it's something bad, you'd better tell him yourself.</p>
<p>I have to go to school. I have to go to school. Bye.</p>
<p>(This is where he thought...</p>
<p>probably the Schatzhauser lives here. (The children laugh gleefully)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Zog ... be ...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara, that was homework!</p>
<p>Didn't you practice?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Maybe you didn't have time to practice?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Maybe she read it to her dad...</p>
<p>and he loved it. - It doesn't help, Lara.</p>
<p>Reading is important.</p>
<p>If you don't do anything at home, you'll just have to stay late.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Keep reading, Uli. But with feeling.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>With feeling? With feeling?</p>
<p>As he spoke, he saw, to his horror...</p>
<p>(He felt as if he had thrown the glass...</p>
<p>How much longer is this going to take?</p>
<p>We have an appointment at the bank.</p>
<p>We have an appointment at the bank.</p>
<p>Not now! We have reading to do. That's important!</p>
<p>Yes, yes, just do it properly, the reading!</p>
<p>I'm so proud of you.</p>
<p>What is it, Mama?</p>
<p>I'm waiting.</p>
<p>(What's so interesting out there? Hm? Bea! What's so funny?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara's mother is outside.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Again?</p>
<p>That was really the last time! Next time I'll make you wait in the playground...</p>
<p>until you're black!</p>
<p>Life is school, not the other way around? Yeah, great!</p>
<p>Explain that to my teacher!</p>
<p>No, I'm sorry, I can't do anything about that until March 1st. Tell them..,</p>
<p>Tell them they're committed for six months... And that the return isn't due until then.</p>
<p>Ask him what about the money we put in...</p>
<p>can't he give us any of it back?</p>
<p>We need money now!</p>
<p>We can't, Dad!</p>
<p>Stop begging!</p>
<p>Ask him!</p>
<p>My father thanks you. He's pleased with your business.</p>
<p>I'm glad.</p>
<p>He says no.</p>
<p>You didn't ask him!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Is there anything else I can do to help your parents?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. If I say it can't be done, it can't be done. Shall we go? - Thank you, Lara.</p>
<p>My parents are the customers, not me. - Thank you very much.</p>
<p>You're supposed to fucking translate what I tell you!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I did!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Would you like another candy?</p>
<p>(In speaking...</p>
<p>saying those words...</p>
<p>No, I don't hear anything yet.</p>
<p>...he saw...</p>
<p>his great horror ...</p>
<p>(Music from the radio)</p>
<p>Now, Dad, now what comes! That's nice! Music!</p>
<p>Leave it on!</p>
<p>Yes, yes. I'll read on.</p>
<p>(Behind the thick ...</p>
<p>Fir ...</p>
<p>Huhu! Grandma! Grandpa! We're here!</p>
<p>(Hello, angel! Merry Christmas, Grandma.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>I don't really remember what she looks like... But I remember what she smells like:</p>
<p>Lily of the valley and summer. - Who does, my dear?</p>
<p>Clarissa! My God, when will they come?</p>
<p>Robert must be on the blink again.</p>
<p>Oh, angel, I envy you so. You speak that magic language</p>
<p>as if it were child's play. If I hadn't listened to that pig-headed man..,</p>
<p>...my hands might be... ...fly.</p>
<p>Will you help me set the table?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hello, Clarissa! Hello, Uncle Gregor!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>My darling!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Merry Christmas, you two! I'm glad you're here.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm just here for the goose.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>We're having roast goose, aren't we?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Stop, come on, they're going in the living room.</p>
<p>Huh? Oh! See, I thought they'd go on the roof! - How's it been so far?</p>
<p>Peaceful. And I'd like it to stay that way.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'd like it to stay that way. It's Christmas.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Can you tell me why you're so late?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Merry Christmas, Dad.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Martin.</p>
<p>Boo! It's freezing cold out there!</p>
<p>And I left my blanket in heaven.</p>
<p>Zapperlot, what do I see? They're nothing but old people!</p>
<p>Aren't there any... any... what do you call those little...</p>
<p>children in this abandoned house? Well, you naughty thing?</p>
<p>I know who you are! You're not Santa Claus at all!</p>
<p>What? You say that, you get nothing. Who am I?</p>
<p>Who am I? Who am I?</p>
<p>Uncle Gre... No, you're not. Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Good girl. Well, then, this is all...</p>
<p>...for you. All of it!</p>
<p>You like it?</p>
<p>I didn't know what to buy...</p>
<p>Go on, take it! I know you can use it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Who gave you that beautiful book? - From dad.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara? Are you coming?</p>
<p>Yes, Grandma.</p>
<p>We'll read it later.</p>
<p>(Shall we play a game, the two of us? - Okay, but no Christmas carols.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Okay, last year's song.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What should I do, Grandma?</p>
<p>You can pick up the napkins, okay?</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>I thought we'd look at the book?</p>
<p>Wait! Clarissa is playing something.</p>
<p>Use your hands when you talk to me!</p>
<p>(Beautiful, you two! (They deserve the beautiful music.</p>
<p>Bravo.</p>
<p>Tell me, Lara. Do you tell the baby stories now and then? Voices and sounds are very important</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>are very important for unborn children.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Is that right, Grandma?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. That's right.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Say, maybe you'd like to spend the night?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, yes! Please, please!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You'll be driving at least an hour in this weather! Hmm?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Come with me.</p>
<p>Don't cheat!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Here. This is for you!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's that?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Whoa!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's my first one! I learned to play on it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Do you want it?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thanks, Clarissa!</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>The lower lip is important. You have to press it flat over your teeth. There, look!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Say, you're quite a talent! (Lara? Lara!</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Your parents want to drive!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh. I have to go down!</p>
<p>Stay a little longer. I'll drive you home tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Go on. Ask her.</p>
<p>Clarissa wants me to stay a little longer. Can I?</p>
<p>She's driving me home tomorrow. Yes?</p>
<p>(It needs little to be happy..,</p>
<p>for he who is happy...</p>
<p>is a king.</p>
<p>(They sing together in canon)</p>
<p>Look! This is my favorite color! Try it.</p>
<p>Mum never wears make-up.</p>
<p>When I was as little as you, I had much shorter hair. Like this.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Want me to cut it? - No, I'll cut it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That would be nice.</p>
<p>It's okay, it's okay. I won't do anything you don't want.</p>
<p>See that?</p>
<p>That's the haircut I used to have.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Is that Dad?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, it's Dad.</p>
<p>That's all of us about 20 years ago! Look, the granny.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You didn't like him.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Who do you mean? Martin?</p>
<p>Did he say that?</p>
<p>That's not true. When we were little, we were very close.</p>
<p>And then? Well, you know your father.</p>
<p>You know how stubborn he can be.</p>
<p>Your grandma, she always protected him. With her he was allowed everything!</p>
<p>On his 15th birthday, he threw all the china off the coffee table.</p>
<p>Imagine, everything broken.</p>
<p>And Grandma didn't even bat an eyelid. He was always her favorite.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Me, I didn't stand a chance.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>But you never learned his language.</p>
<p>Yes, I did a little. When we were little..,</p>
<p>we used to make up our own imaginary signs.</p>
<p>But the doctors said that was a mistake.</p>
<p>That sign language was keeping him from learning to talk.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>You look beautiful in that dress.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Should I take it off?</p>
<p>Don't worry. I'll make you beautiful. I'll make you beautiful!</p>
<p>(Melancholic music)</p>
<p>We had said in the afternoon!</p>
<p>How do you look?</p>
<p>Why are you crying?</p>
<p>Now you look like her...</p>
<p>...isn't that what you wanted?</p>
<p>We're stuck!</p>
<p>Hey, Dad! Let go, Dad!</p>
<p>Hey! Let go, Dad!</p>
<p>(music from recorder)</p>
<p>Mommy? Why can't you ride a bike?</p>
<p>You don't have a good sense of balance because of your ears?</p>
<p>I wish you'd learn. All real mothers</p>
<p>can ride a bike!</p>
<p>When the baby comes. Promise?</p>
<p>Boo... Listen, you in there. You don't have to be afraid.</p>
<p>It's not completely quiet out here. When you come, I'll be here,</p>
<p>and I'll play you something on my new clarinet.</p>
<p>(One, two, three!</p>
<p>(Children's song: "The Cockoo and the Donkey")</p>
<p>(The children play wrong)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>How often do I have to say it: The cellos are always too high!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Mr. Gardener!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not now, we're in the middle of rehearsal. We're in the middle of rehearsal!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And the flutes don't listen to each other!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Mrs. Mertens sent me down.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I play the clarinet.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can you read music?</p>
<p>She can't even read books!</p>
<p>Come here. Come on.</p>
<p>What is not, can still be.</p>
<p>I don't give up hope that you'll remember...</p>
<p>that you'll remember the two triangle stakes by parents' evening.</p>
<p>(C... D... F... G.</p>
<p>(Plays the scale)</p>
<p>Like this. Wonderful. Now hold the last note.</p>
<p>Great, and now the whole thing from the beginning: Der Gute Claus darf Früher Gehen.</p>
<p>I didn't want to learn poetry.</p>
<p>(Lara plays the scale)</p>
<p>My homework? I have nothing on.</p>
<p>I'm not lazy! And I've already gotten better, says Mrs. Mertens.</p>
<p>Papa! What are you doing? Give me back my clarinet!</p>
<p>What? The music distracts me from studying? Nonsense!</p>
<p>Studying isn't more important!</p>
<p>What do you know about what's important?</p>
<p>You're deaf. You don't even know what music is.</p>
<p>Boah! You're mean! You never cared about my school!</p>
<p>You don't and Mommy doesn't! You just don't want</p>
<p>that I know how to play the clarinet. I hate you!</p>
<p>I'm going to lose it</p>
<p>Only if you make the same mistake...</p>
<p>...like your parents did.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You have to take her as she is.</p>
<p>Hearing.</p>
<p>We're deaf.</p>
<p>She's my child.</p>
<p>But she's not yours.</p>
<p>(bells ringing)</p>
<p>(church organ)</p>
<p>Praise the Lord, mighty King of Glory.</p>
<p>My beloved soul,</p>
<p>this is my desire.</p>
<p>Come to me,</p>
<p>Psaltery and harp, awake.</p>
<p>Let the song of praise be heard.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord, who rules all things so gloriously.</p>
<p>[Shouting]</p>
<p>Who keeps you safe on Adeler's wing...</p>
<p>Mama! Mama!</p>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
<p>So much longer? Yes, I still want to wait.</p>
<p>I'll stay here with you until the baby comes.</p>
<p>Yes, they make a noise. They sound like bells.</p>
<p>The more wind, the louder they ring.</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
<p>Were you happy when Clarissa was born?</p>
<p>First... and then?</p>
<p>Didn't you ever play together when you were my age?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>When Clarissa was 9 or 10, she gave her first concert...</p>
<p>in front of a big audience.</p>
<p>Grandpa invited a lot of important people.</p>
<p>I think it was his 50th birthday.</p>
<p>Everyone was very excited that day.</p>
<p>Clarissa had to play a few pieces on the clarinet.</p>
<p>She practiced for a long time.</p>
<p>And Grandpa was very, very proud of his daughter.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>(Robert, Robert, let him be!</p>
<p>Mum! Mom!</p>
<p>From that night on, Clarissa never wanted to play when I was in the room.</p>
<p>So I spent many evenings alone in the nursery.</p>
<p>Lara! Lara!</p>
<p>I got it from a friend who teaches at the high school.</p>
<p>It's still a bit demanding, but give it a try.</p>
<p>We haven't had any pieces with triplets yet. When you get to this part,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>you just count quietly: "1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3!" - That fast?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>As fast as you can,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>As fast as you can. I thought since everything was in G major...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So this is an F sharp.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...</p>
<p>Next year we'll look for a private teacher for you.</p>
<p>Should I discuss it with your parents?</p>
<p>I'd rather not. They're pretty busy with our baby right now.</p>
<p>Are you going to Uli's birthday party?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Why not?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Because he didn't invite me.</p>
<p>Don't be sad, Lara. Ravens fly in flocks.</p>
<p>But the eagle flies alone.</p>
<p>Don't complain, it's time you did.</p>
<p>You want to look beautiful, don't you? Yes.</p>
<p>Hey, Mom! Don't!</p>
<p>Don't, Mama!</p>
<p>I'm supposed to read her a story.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to talk to her a lot!</p>
<p>Oh yeah? How do you know she's tired?</p>
<p>Did she tell you that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Marie? Did you hear that? Marie! Marie!</p>
<p>Do you hear that? Marie! Marie!</p>
<p>Do you hear me? Marie!</p>
<p>(Marie cries)</p>
<p>Hey, you can hear!</p>
<p>She can hear! She can hear! Marie, you can hear. You can hear, Marie.</p>
<p>Everything you said sounds so beautiful.</p>
<p>Yes, and? What's bothering you?</p>
<p>No, no, everything's different. I'm not like I used to be.</p>
<p>But you must know one thing, Maria! You do love me.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You know you love me.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, yes!</p>
<p>Look at me, Maria! We have our whole lives ahead of us.</p>
<p>You and I.</p>
<p>Nothing can separate us now.</p>
<p>From now on, we'll always be together.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>(Lara!</p>
<p>A bike ride? But I think you can not, Mom?</p>
<p>(Music, Laughter)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(Honk)</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>So, except for the triangle inserts, everything was quite nice.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm just not so musical.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, you don't say!</p>
<p>And maybe next time the trumpet will take out the chewing gum!</p>
<p>Nice of you to come. Lara's a wonderful student,</p>
<p>but please understand my concern. She can't possibly transfer</p>
<p>if she doesn't get better at reading and writing.</p>
<p>My reading is improving...</p>
<p>...but it's still not perfect.</p>
<p>Yes, and besides, she can't keep dropping out of class early.</p>
<p>Tell her we're glad she lets you leave early once in a while...</p>
<p>Are we almost there?</p>
<p>...it's hard to find a good interpreter here.</p>
<p>It's summer vacation soon, so I won't have to leave class early.</p>
<p>But tell them that this is really my last word.</p>
<p>Next time I just won't let you go.</p>
<p>You're a wonderful teacher. Lara really likes you.</p>
<p>She thinks you're quite nice.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How nice. Thank you.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Finally, I get to see you!</p>
<p>Your daughter really is an extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>I'll reserve you two front-row tickets to the parents' evening. Do you mind?</p>
<p>This is my music teacher.</p>
<p>He thinks it's a shame</p>
<p>He thinks it's a shame you never let me play the clarinet.</p>
<p>We have to pick up the baby now. Are there any questions?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara, are you sure you told them all my concerns?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I told them everything.</p>
<p>Not word for word, but pretty much.</p>
<p>The easiest note is the G! No fingers, look!</p>
<p>It's never happened before. Maybe they never use it,</p>
<p>because it's so easy.</p>
<p>Mm-hm. I did my math on the bus. I have to read a story,</p>
<p>but I can do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>Are you coming tomorrow?</p>
<p>Sure, the baby ...</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>The sun sounds in the old way in the brother sphere chant</p>
<p>and its prescribed journey</p>
<p>is completed with the sound of thunder!</p>
<p>The sight of her gives the angels strength... strength,</p>
<p>(...when none may... when no one may proclaim you.</p>
<p>The incredibly great works are glorious as the first day!</p>
<p>It's your turn now. Are you all right?</p>
<p>You're doing fine! You're doing very, very well! Huh?</p>
<p>(And now Lara Bischoff from Class 3c...</p>
<p>She'll play a piece for us on the clarinet.</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
<p>(Silent)</p>
<p>It's the best! Absolutely.</p>
<p>Students come from all over the world.</p>
<p>Why don't you say something? Lara's future is at stake.</p>
<p>So you're trying to take away the only talented student I've ever had.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm not sure I find that funny.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She's gotta do something with her talent.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She can't become anything here.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She's got a point!</p>
<p>I don't know. I'd have to get a room. I'd have to get a room. It's too expensive.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>There's a way.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You don't believe yourself,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>that dad takes money from you.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I don't want to give it to him, but to you!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can I write you some kind of recommendation?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Music isn't that important to me.</p>
<p>If you don't accept the offer, you're missing a huge opportunity!</p>
<p>Besides, you can't spend your life taking care of your parents.</p>
<p>Oh, Clarisse!</p>
<p>You show up every lunar year with a different idea every time!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Sometimes I think you're just bored!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, exactly! And that's why I'm going to make you...</p>
<p>a last offer. You come to us over the summer and we'll rehearse</p>
<p>a few pieces together. Every day. All summer long, just playing and going to concerts.</p>
<p>And then we'll see if it's enough for the entrance exam. Do you want to?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can I come along?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You know I want to.</p>
<p>You don't know how bored I am with your uncle all day.</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>(Music of the 60s)</p>
<p>(Melancholic music)</p>
<p>What's wrong with Marie? Can't she make a phone call for you?</p>
<p>Ok, I'm coming.</p>
<p>I was drinking. With a few friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. I'll bring her by sometime.</p>
<p>Mom wants me to make some calls.</p>
<p>(Melancholic music)</p>
<p>See this beautiful night?</p>
<p>Take a good look...</p>
<p>Things are changing fast.</p>
<p>Soon it will be spring...</p>
<p>the snow will melt.</p>
<p>What does the snow sound like?</p>
<p>What does it say to you?</p>
<p>It says, "Crunch, crunch! Whoa, whoa..."</p>
<p>What's that? "Crunch" and "brr"?</p>
<p>What kind of weird words are those?</p>
<p>Well, honestly, snow doesn't say much.</p>
<p>In fact, they say that snow swallows up all sound.</p>
<p>When there's snow, everything is much quieter.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Snow makes the world go quiet?</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Clarissa was at school today.</p>
<p>I didn't know she was here either.</p>
<p>Her birthday's coming up. Grandpa wants to take us all out to dinner.</p>
<p>Please! Come with me, Papa. For my sake.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Ew. You pig.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It's just chocolate.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Before dinner?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Bettina threw a round.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hi! - Hi.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Bettina's sleeping over.</p>
<p>Her parents are away. Can we borrow your clarinet?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>No way!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Why not? Afraid I'll break it?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Have you set the table yet?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I just want to show it to Bettina! Please!</p>
<p>Stop it! You're not getting it, okay? If you're bored, help mommy in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I don't want it, your stupid horn! It gets on everyone's nerves anyway, your music!</p>
<p>You hear that? It's like this all day long!</p>
<p>I'm sick to death of this drone. Ah!</p>
<p>Shh, come on!</p>
<p>(Come on.</p>
<p>Ouch, Mom. Ouch, ouch! Help!</p>
<p>Ouch! Ouch!</p>
<p>Nothing. Louder, come on, hurry up!</p>
<p>Ouch! Ouch, mom! Ouch! Help! Ouch!</p>
<p>Ouch, mama! Ouch! Ouch, help!</p>
<p>Marie! Did you hurt yourself? (The girls giggle)</p>
<p>What's this crap?</p>
<p>Bettina thinks that maybe our parents are not really deaf.</p>
<p>She thinks that maybe they are spies that someone has sent to monitor us!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>We just tested Mom!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Have you gone completely crazy?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hey! - Aren't you ashamed?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nope, why?</p>
<p>Lara!</p>
<p>She thinks it's funny. When she was a child.</p>
<p>she always imagined strange things.</p>
<p>See, she didn't think it was so bad! Only you have to get so upset again!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Go back to playing your stupid clarinet!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Be glad that you have ears</p>
<p>to hear it, my stupid clarinet. - Dad can't hear anything, and he hates it anyway,</p>
<p>your music! - I can move out if you all don't like it.</p>
<p>Then you'll look stupid!</p>
<p>(How's work with the kids?</p>
<p>I think I'll stop teaching again. (But little Keller...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>But little Keller has made wonderful progress with you.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Julia moved to Frankfurt with her parents.</p>
<p>and the others aren't really interested.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It's boring.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What do you say to that? Gregor!</p>
<p>Me? Uh... yes, of course she has talents.</p>
<p>The kids are crazy about her.</p>
<p>But if she doesn't feel like it...</p>
<p>You can't live your whole life on the pleasure principle!</p>
<p>You have to do something. Or are you just going to spend your husband's money?</p>
<p>Well, that's not fair. I've always earned my own money. - You have? What did you do?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I haven't lived up to your expectations, Dad.</p>
<p>Money is really not the point. (Now stop all this arguing!</p>
<p>(The sugar, please, Lilly. (It's Clarissa's birthday!</p>
<p>It's Christmas! It's Clarissa's birthday!</p>
<p>It's not my fault we only see each other...</p>
<p>on these stupid holidays! - But we don't have to talk about the same things...</p>
<p>about the same topics every time. (What else can we talk about?</p>
<p>Talk? I'd call that a put-down.</p>
<p>(Excuse me, can we have the cake quickly? (Yes, right away!</p>
<p>(But we've been through this.</p>
<p>If you had children, a family... I wonder what you do all day?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Cleaning!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, that's it. Cleaning.</p>
<p>Cleaning, like this.</p>
<p>Well, she'll have enough to do in the summer, when Lara lives with us.</p>
<p>Marie! (Father) What? Lara is moving in with you?</p>
<p>What? You haven't told them yet?</p>
<p>You haven't told them yet? I thought we had discussed it.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Don't keep me in suspense!</p>
<p>What's with all the secrecy? (Happy birthday to you!</p>
<p>What hasn't Lara told you?</p>
<p>I'd rather tell them myself, Clarissa.</p>
<p>You don't dare anyway. Lara will stay with us for the summer...</p>
<p>I'll prepare her for the exams, and if all goes well...</p>
<p>she'll go to the conservatory.</p>
<p>(To Berlin? Isn't there anything a bit closer?</p>
<p>(I think it's a good idea. Lara's talent should be encouraged.</p>
<p>Maybe she'll make something of it. (But Berlin is so far away!</p>
<p>Then you must really live there. Do you want to move out?</p>
<p>Lara is 18 years old! There comes a time for everyone.</p>
<p>If Martin and Kai have something against it, then of course it won't work.</p>
<p>Do you always have to stab me in the back?</p>
<p>I stab you in the back? I'm lucky..,</p>
<p>I'm lucky if I get a word in edgewise.</p>
<p>Martin. Leave her alone. She's a wonderful clarinetist!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And I want her to be promoted!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>We'll take care of the finances!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't worry about that.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She needs to get out of this nest.</p>
<p>She's taken care of you long enough.</p>
<p>(Please, Clarissa! For God's sake, cut it out!</p>
<p>Why? School is just what she needs.</p>
<p>Besides, you can visit her during that time.</p>
<p>But we wanted to go to Italy in the summer! All together!</p>
<p>Yes, but this is more important. Martin and Kai must finally understand.</p>
<p>Lara doesn't have to live the life of a handicapped person..,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>just because her parents are handicapped.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm the father.</p>
<p>She's my daughter!</p>
<p>Martin, sit down!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Clarissa, you've really gone too far.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, exactly. Now it's my fault again.</p>
<p>He throws red wine in my face and you defend him. Shit!</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you tonight. Clarissa was just faster!</p>
<p>Nothing's been decided yet! Clarissa just wants me</p>
<p>for the entrance exam, that's all! She just wants to help me.</p>
<p>She doesn't think she's doing anything. That's nonsense.</p>
<p>Do you think you and Mom can get along without me?</p>
<p>I'll treat you like a baby.</p>
<p>I don't want to run away!</p>
<p>Yeah, if that's not what this is about... What is it about?</p>
<p>I ruined their evening again...</p>
<p>They were ashamed of me.</p>
<p>As usual.</p>
<p>So what? It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Why did you have to go to Clarissa's?</p>
<p>Can't you imagine how it hurts me?</p>
<p>But I want to be a musician, nothing else.</p>
<p>Don't you understand?</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish you were deaf too...</p>
<p>...so you could be in my world.</p>
<p>I think it's really mean that you're driving! Now I have to translate all those love stories</p>
<p>for Mom! Don't be a jerk,</p>
<p>You don't help enough anyway.</p>
<p>Can I at least sleep in your bed?</p>
<p>Can I at least sleep in your bed while you're away? If it pleases you.</p>
<p>Yes, I will! And don't pack Romy!</p>
<p>Why do parents always talk about schoolwork?</p>
<p>(Stomps on)</p>
<p>When I was little, I firmly believed that all people, when they grow up,</p>
<p>...they could sing. I thought that when I grew up, I could do it too.</p>
<p>I used to stand in front of a mirror and move my mouth...</p>
<p>...and imagined beautiful sounds coming out of it...</p>
<p>Sounds that make people look so ecstatic, so happy.</p>
<p>Music.</p>
<p>I used to dance in front of the mirror and hold my brush in front of my mouth,</p>
<p>as a microphone.</p>
<p>What's that, Mama?</p>
<p>You're not sure I like this music.</p>
<p>It's a clarinet concerto. You read about it in the paper.</p>
<p>Sure I did! I'm sure it's very good!</p>
<p>But why two tickets?</p>
<p>Yes, we'll have a nice evening together. I think it would be wonderful..,</p>
<p>if you came with me.</p>
<p>(stomps on floor)</p>
<p>Thank you. I'm glad you came.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It's nice that you're here.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Why didn't Clarissa</p>
<p>Why didn't Clarissa come to the station? - She's not feeling well this morning. - Oh!</p>
<p>Nothing serious. She's usually better after sunset.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Do you know what time it is?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara! There you are at last!</p>
<p>Come on, let's go! Come on, get up! I want to see the city! - You want to see the city?</p>
<p>Yes, now you've dragged me all the way here,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>now I want to see the city too!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>See the city. Do you know how big the city is?</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(Walter) Hey, Clarissa!</p>
<p>This is Lara, my niece. Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang ...</p>
<p>Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter. Hello.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Are you visiting Berlin?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She wants to go to the conservatory. But we have to get her used</p>
<p>to get her used to the big city. Hello.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So you're a musician?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not yet.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>She plays the clarinet and she's very good at it!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And now you want to see Berlin?</p>
<p>(Unintelligible conversation)</p>
<p>(Unintelligible)</p>
<p>(Drums start)</p>
<p>Lara, come!</p>
<p>Come! Yes, come!</p>
<p>We have already played! We start together.</p>
<p>Wonderful!</p>
<p>You, go on!</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is my lake.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Wow. And in the middle of the city!</p>
<p>The only place that makes me a little nostalgic.</p>
<p>It always makes me think of home. It even froze over last winter.</p>
<p>If someone comes now!</p>
<p>(Melancholic clarinet music)</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>I don't like this melancholic stuff. It spoils the mood</p>
<p>for the whole day. Don't worry. I'll pick out some nice tunes for you.</p>
<p>I don't know if I want to play anything else. I like the music.</p>
<p>But you won't make it with that.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Says who?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Says me.</p>
<p>You wanna depress the commission to death?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I think they should admit you!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Clarissa, that's complete nonsense.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>The greatest composers...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Either you believe me,</p>
<p>or you can try it alone.</p>
<p>Gregor!</p>
<p>You could really listen just once! - Me? Come on, this is ridiculous!</p>
<p>You're so full of shit!</p>
<p>Asshole!</p>
<p>(Conversations in the background)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Stupid, if you're so stared at, right?</p>
<p>I've been watching you.</p>
<p>I noticed it ...</p>
<p>Hello! I'm Johanna. Who are you?</p>
<p>L-a-r-a</p>
<p>T-o-m</p>
<p>Actually we wanted to go to the park...</p>
<p>but I'm allowed to look here for a moment!</p>
<p>Right, right, right. And "quick" is just about up.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can I help you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yeah, we want those gloves.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Aren't you deaf?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Me? No. You?</p>
<p>Prego. - How much is it? 5.80. What do you want, kid?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>My father is deaf.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He raised me alone.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Ciao, thanks!</p>
<p>And now I'm a teacher at a school for the deaf.</p>
<p>Actually, we should practice articulation today. What about you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How come you're so good at sign language?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm the same way with parents.</p>
<p>Watch out, it's slippery here!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm taking Johanna home. Are you coming?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'LL BE GONE IN TWO MONTHS ANYWAY.</p>
<p>I'll be gone in two months anyway. I'm going to Washington for a semester.</p>
<p>Gallaudet School. It's a deaf-only university. They study everything there.</p>
<p>Medicine, art history, law. All in sign language.</p>
<p>The Americans have long since recognized it as a full-fledged language.</p>
<p>They're 20 years ahead of us. - I always wanted to have a father..,</p>
<p>I could be proud of. One who would defend me against the world</p>
<p>and sing me songs at bedtime. - One who can't understand..,</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>what you like better about Guns 'n' Roses than Beethoven.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Exactly.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>6:30. I gotta get home.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What? 6:30 already? That's so late.</p>
<p>Will you come and see me at school? I'm there every day.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>I thought I'd visit you.</p>
<p>It's Lara! She came to visit!</p>
<p>Maybe she wants to be a teacher!</p>
<p>Lie down!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lie down on the floor!</p>
<p>On your belly! (rock music)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Or don't you want to join in?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Just wait! Eyes closed. (Turns up the music)</p>
<p>Poor Lara. I think she can't feel music!</p>
<p>Hey! Are you going to the movies with me tomorrow?</p>
<p>Clarissa?</p>
<p>Lara, come in! Come on!</p>
<p>It's wonderful, the water. Ah!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I didn't bring my swimsuit!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So what? You're a bore! Come in!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Aren't you scared here? In the middle of the night?</p>
<p>First one to the buoy!</p>
<p>Where did Gregor go?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He's looking for an apartment.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He's looking for an apartment.</p>
<p>He says my music gives him a toothache.</p>
<p>They're all against us. All of them!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Clarissa?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Huh?</p>
<p>Why don't you have a baby? Gregor and you?</p>
<p>I don't know whose fault it is. It never worked out.</p>
<p>Maybe nature doesn't want a baby to have a mother like me.</p>
<p>I did it all wrong.</p>
<p>Martin has you, Kai and Marie. A real home.</p>
<p>I don't have anything.</p>
<p>That's not true. Clarissa, you have so much.</p>
<p>You're beautiful and strong, and you make wonderful music.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to be like you.</p>
<p>Beautiful, isn't it? Wasn't it? You didn't like it?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Somehow movies like that make me sad.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Sad? Love stories with happy endings</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>make you sad?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, they do. They make me dissatisfied...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>with what I have. I mean, they give you so much hope.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hope?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, yes, a common evil.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have to be careful with your dreams.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Most of them don't come true anyway.</p>
<p>Hey, why are you so serious? You're not even 20</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>and you talk like Mrs. Kowalschek.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Who's that?</p>
<p>My caretaker. But she's 70, fat and ugly! Hangs around the window all day</p>
<p>with the poodle and the pillow at the window. Don't you have anything nice in your life?</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>You're driving me crazy, you ungrateful thing!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't feel so sorry for yourself!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm hungry.</p>
<p>Go on. Giddyup! Hey!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Here! Let's get some schnitzel!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What, schnitzel?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hello! Two schnitzels, please.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I don't have any money!</p>
<p>It's on me.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>A schnitzel with ketchup for you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh no. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Song: I WILL SURVIVE)</p>
<p>That's Gloria Gaynor. I loved this when I was 14.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p>Come here to me.</p>
<p>Come here to me, my girl.</p>
<p>Your mother had an accident last night, on her bike.</p>
<p>She's dead.</p>
<p>(Lara cries)</p>
<p>(Melancholic Music)</p>
<p>(Melancholic music)</p>
<p>(Cries)</p>
<p>No sound, Papa. She does it silently.</p>
<p>She should never have learned to ride a bike. That was a mistake.</p>
<p>She had trouble with her balance.</p>
<p>Are you saying it's my fault?</p>
<p>Hey, look at me! Talk to me, damn it.</p>
<p>You don't believe that!</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>The music bothers you.</p>
<p>You don't want music in your house. In your house?</p>
<p>I'm sure it won't be later than 11:00 if the bus is on time. You okay?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Do you have to go?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yeah, I have to go. I haven't been out in months.</p>
<p>And I'm on the verge of going insane...</p>
<p>Besides, the tickets are from Mom.</p>
<p>Why can't I go?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have two!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>One has to stay with Dad.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have to put him to bed.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Let him put himself to bed.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm not his babysitter.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So, careful, missy. Don't be cheeky!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How do I look? How do I look?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Too colorful.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Really? Clarissa wears make-up like that too.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Clarissa looks good too.</p>
<p>I love you so much. You know that, right?</p>
<p>(Listen to the sound of the picture!)</p>
<p>Listen, the sound of the picture!</p>
<p>Can you hear it?</p>
<p>He's a great artist: Chagall.</p>
<p>He knows, that el mundo is music.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You want to know the truth of music?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes. I want to learn it.</p>
<p>Learn? You don't need it! You have it inside!</p>
<p>Listen to the song inside.</p>
<p>(Spanish) Giora, prisa! El concierto va a comenzar.</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
<p>(Plays a melancholy tune)</p>
<p>(South American melody)</p>
<p>(South American melody)</p>
<p>(South American melody)</p>
<p>(Melancholic melody)</p>
<p>Tom?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>You passed me on the bus earlier.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how you are.</p>
<p>Your aunt told me that ... I'm flying tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Lara, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>I just heard a beautiful concert.</p>
<p>I want to go to that school so bad! I have to get into that school.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Do you think I'm good enough?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I've never heard you play.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Do you want me to play for you? Now?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Now?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>There must be some advantage to our fathers being deaf.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You're in a good mood again.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Shh! My sister hears even better!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't you need a light for the notes?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It's all in my head!</p>
<p>So, cut me some slack! I just made it up!</p>
<p>(Plays a melancholic tune)</p>
<p>(Melancholic music)</p>
<p>(Romantic music)</p>
<p>(Romantic music)</p>
<p>(Romantic music)</p>
<p>Did you know that bees are deaf?</p>
<p>Really, teacher?</p>
<p>But they can sense sounds through their sense of touch.</p>
<p>Now she hears your heart beating.</p>
<p>Can't I stay at your place? I have to prepare for the exam somewhere.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And I want to get out of here.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I've already rented it to a friend for the semester.</p>
<p>I'm renting it to a friend for the semester. I can't leave him hanging.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>Why are you so sad, little Lara?</p>
<p>The saddest things in life are breakups and death.</p>
<p>I don't want to say goodbye anymore. I've had enough of it.</p>
<p>Oh! You're not rid of me yet. Our story's just beginning.</p>
<p>And we make a pretty good couple, a clarinetist...</p>
<p>A clarinetist and a teacher of the deaf. It's a great match.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I don't want you to leave.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm almost back.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Where did you come from?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I went for a walk...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Aren't you a bit late?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What time is it? It's only 7:15.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Did you enjoy the concert? - Mm</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>m.</p>
<p>So-so. Around 12, I think.</p>
<p>So what? I wasn't there at 11:00. I'm 18 years old.</p>
<p>I'm allowed to be an hour late.</p>
<p>You can do some things, but not everything? What's wrong now?</p>
<p>First of all, he doesn't like it when you bring men home...</p>
<p>and with them in the living room... Who was there?</p>
<p>Well, what? What did I do wrong again, Dad? What else are you going to accuse me of?</p>
<p>That I'm irresponsible? That I'm selfish?</p>
<p>That I only think about myself and my music? That I stabbed you and Mom in the back?</p>
<p>That I took Clarissa's side? Want me to tell you something?</p>
<p>I can't stand her anymore. Your reproachful silent looks...</p>
<p>Your complaints. I can't stand the silence in this house..,</p>
<p>the noises you make when you read the paper, when you eat..,</p>
<p>when you brush your teeth. This house has become like a cage.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara! Why are you saying all this?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I've had enough!</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>I'm looking for my aunt, Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here?</p>
<p>Lara! What are you doing here? Come in!</p>
<p>Walter is a photographer!</p>
<p>He's going to Spain to take pictures for a travel magazine!</p>
<p>He thinks I can help him.</p>
<p>As his assistant, so to speak. We're leaving next week.</p>
<p>And Gregor? And Gregor?</p>
<p>Your uncle has chosen to live alone.</p>
<p>You did the right thing, Lara. Your music is more important now.</p>
<p>Martin will understand.</p>
<p>But that's typical of him:</p>
<p>He behaves like a madman and we have the guilty conscience.</p>
<p>You have no idea what's going on in his head.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's going on now?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have no right</p>
<p>You have no right to judge him. You never bothered to get to know him in the first place.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Lara, I just want you to get out of there...</p>
<p>What is it you want from me, Clarissa?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think you just want to win. You want me to go to...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>to go to that school. For whatever reason.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, nonsense. I want you to be good. Really good.</p>
<p>All your personal problems</p>
<p>are distracting you from your music! - Yeah, you want me to be good.</p>
<p>I am good. But not better than you. - That's not fair.</p>
<p>And that's why you're so against my music. You think it's boring, depressing.</p>
<p>If you were really interested in me, you would have supported me..,</p>
<p>...what I wanted. You never did. - Oh, ladies! You're not going to get into a fight</p>
<p>...to get in each other's hair! - Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p>You don't know what we're talking about! - Coffee?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Just like your father. That's great. Now I finally see you for who you are.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's right. You're my father.</p>
<p>I'm my father's child. And I'm not the daughter</p>
<p>you never had! And above all, I'm not you!</p>
<p>That's my publishing house over there.</p>
<p>You sleep here.</p>
<p>I'll sleep downstairs.</p>
<p>I'm due next month. My publisher's getting impatient!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I only play when you're not here.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You can play whenever you want.</p>
<p>After 12 years with your aunt, I can sleep through any noise.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Gregor?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Are you sorry you moved out?</p>
<p>Do you regret moving out?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>But it can still happen.</p>
<p>Then why did you leave?</p>
<p>There's no place for me in Clarissa's head.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>There's you and Robert and Martin.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>But they're always fighting.</p>
<p>Still... I wish she'd ever loved me like that.</p>
<p>Besides, she eats such a damn healthy diet! That got on my nerves.</p>
<p>Everything in her fridge is green. I don't eat anything</p>
<p>that's green. Except chewing gum!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>(phone)</p>
<p>Yes? Ah, Marie! Hello! Where are you?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Am very close! In the middle of town.</p>
<p>Can you pick me up? I don't know which subway</p>
<p>which subway to take.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Are you alone?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Lara!</p>
<p>Are you out of your mind? Alone on the train!</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>To visit you.</p>
<p>You came 500 km by train for that? I don't have any time!</p>
<p>Does Dad know you're here?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Of course he does. I left him a note.</p>
<p>A note? What did it say?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That I was going to a party</p>
<p>after school. It said the party was 500 kilometers away,</p>
<p>I didn't write it down.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's he saying?</p>
<p>You know. Is he talking about me?</p>
<p>M-m. I didn't think it was so nice, what you said.</p>
<p>Shut up. You don't have to say that to me now.</p>
<p>Can you come back soon, please?</p>
<p>The exam is in four days.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How am I supposed to get home?</p>
<p>Why, don't you have a return ticket?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I ran out of money.</p>
<p>I ran out of money. And it's almost night.</p>
<p>And I'm only 9!</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>(There's a problem sleeping right in front of me.</p>
<p>Come here, you'll see it. We need your help.</p>
<p>Yeah. Family thing!</p>
<p>The tank's full. I filled it up yesterday.</p>
<p>I filled it up yesterday.</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>What's he doing, 220?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Be careful driving.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Take care, Marie. Say hello to Martin from me!</p>
<p>(Music)</p>
<p>Other fathers are proud of their daughters ...</p>
<p>when they succeed.</p>
<p>Why don't you help me?</p>
<p>You can't send me in there alone.</p>
<p>Dad'll tear me apart.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I drove you all the way.</p>
<p>You'll have to walk the last 10 yards yourself.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Go on. He'll be glad you're back.</p>
<p>I drove Marie home.</p>
<p>I drove Marie home.</p>
<p>Hey! Since when does Clarissa know our language?</p>
<p>Is Lara still with you?</p>
<p>Is she okay?</p>
<p>No. She's not okay. She misses you.</p>
<p>Come on, I'll take you to her.</p>
<p>Why didn't she come?</p>
<p>Because she doesn't have time! You have to come to her!</p>
<p>Ow, yeah! We'll go right back! All together, yes?</p>
<p>No, we can't.</p>
<p>Stop feeling sorry for yourself!</p>
<p>It must be a family problem...</p>
<p>Oh man, Dad. Why didn't you come?</p>
<p>And if you run off again...</p>
<p>I'll kick your ass!</p>
<p>(alarm clock rings)</p>
<p>(Silent)</p>
<p>What instrument?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Clarinet.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thank you.</p>
<p>Lara Bischoff? Come in, please.</p>
<p>[Silent]</p>
<p>Miss Bischoff, in your documents..,</p>
<p>that you're interested in traditional klezmer music.</p>
<p>What interests you in this musical genre?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It's hard to say.</p>
<p>It's such a feeling. Maybe because it's so emotional.</p>
<p>Emotional? Well...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I mean, she's...</p>
<p>She's happy and wild at heart, and at the same time she's...</p>
<p>sad and not really free. And that connection,</p>
<p>I can understand it. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Then let's start with the main subject.</p>
<p>Miss Bischoff, you brought us three pieces?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes. If you don't mind,</p>
<p>I'll start with the contemporary piece?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>As you wish.</p>
<p>We don't care about the order.</p>
<p>I want to see you play, is that all right?</p>
<p>Miss Bishop, we're waiting.</p>
<p>Are you all right? Would you like some water?</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. Let's go. It's not so bad.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>I just want to keep my fingers crossed for you.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Dad? Why did you come?</p>
<p>I wanted to see what's so important to you...</p>
<p>and I want to see how you play.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but would you mind letting us in on this?</p>
<p>Yes. It's my father! He's deaf. He'd like to watch.</p>
<p>Well, if he wants to, but... I really must ask you now.</p>
<p>That's it, show them!</p>
<p>Please, Dad. Don't say any more! You're getting me all mixed up.</p>
<p>So that's it, your music?</p>
<p>Yes. That's my music. Do you think you'll ever understand it?</p>
<p>I may not be able to hear it...</p>
<p>...but I'll try to "understand" it!</p>
<p>Did I...</p>
<p>...lost you?</p>
<p>I've loved you since the day I was born.</p>
<p>You'll never lose me.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming.</p>
