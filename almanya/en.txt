This is me with my grandfather. This is the first picture of us together.
And this is us today, many years later with the whole family.
Me on the far left, and Grandpa on the far right.
This is the last picture there is of us.
Shortly after this picture was taken, everything changed.
I often think about how my life would have turned out,
if I had been born in Turkey and not in Germany.
But the fact that I am "made in Germany" is thanks to the German economic miracle.
Go with the economy (Go with it, Go with it)
Go along on this tour
Look, the others are already standing there
and are already taking their fill of cream at the big banquet.
Since the mid-fifties, there has been a steady stream of workers...
mainly from the south of Europe.
German doctors examine the men's and women's fitness for work right on the spot.
The procedure resembles that of a cattle market.
Those who are found to be fit are allowed to go to Germany.
They know the acute need on the job market, and, uh....
And since at that time not enough skilled workers - Italians, Spaniards - were available...
we resorted to Turkish guest workers.
On September 10, 1964, a guest worker made German history.
On that day, the number of immigrants...
reached a historic record.
One of these men was destined to go on to fame and glory.
- After you. - No, after you.
Congratulations! You are the one millionth guest worker in Germany! Welcome!
But only one, unfortunately.
What do you think of Germany?
Where are you from? From which country?
Step aside, please!
But Armando Rodriguez, the millionth guest worker...
the honors and a moped with two seats met with incomprehension.
Apparently, the newcomer has not yet understood that he and his kind...
have become indispensable for German prosperity.
Even though Armando Rodriguez made headlines as the one millionth at the time,
we tell here...
the story of the one millionth.
A man named Huseyin Yilmaz, my grandfather.
And so grandpa stepped into his promising future.
Huseyin.
Huseyin.
Huseyin!
Huseyin!
Man, Hüseyin, wait a minute!
45 years later
I have changed my mind.
I don't want the German passport after all.
Have you lost your mind?
We didn't apply for naturalization for nothing.
It wasn't my idea anyway.
Almighty, give me strength.
Why am I even arguing with you?
We'll go there tomorrow and pick up our German passports!
While my grandparents thought they had a problem, I was facing a real one.
It can't be! I take the pill every morning!
Shit man, David, what have you done?!
- Me? - What kind of sperms do you have?
So we all had our problems.
Also my little cousin Cenk.
Cenk, what's wrong with you? Where should we put your flag?
Germany?
Yes, yes, it is true, but what is the name of the beautiful country where your father comes from?
Anatolia.
It is called Italy.
No, Cenk is right, it is called Anatolia and it is in the east in Turkey.
Unfortunately, this is only a map of Europe,
It stops here at Istanbul.
We can put the flag here, right?
Engin, what about you?
Istanbul.
Istanbul, nice!
Well, then... Yes, we'll have them all.
What should I wear tomorrow? This?
Or this?
Woman, have you gone crazy? They're both the same. God almighty!
How can you be so calm? Aren't you excited at all?
No!
Almighty, give me strength.
Almighty, don't listen to them. Give me strength!
Or would you prefer this one?
Like this...
Mr. and Mrs. Yilmaz...
All that's missing is item four on one hundred and eighteen...
As...
As a soon-to-be German citizen, you must adopt German culture as your guiding culture.
Very nice, that means you will become a member of a shooting club,
eat pork twice a week...
You watch "Tatort" every Sunday and spend every other summer on Mallorca.
Are you ready to take on these responsibilities?
- But... - Yes, of course.
Must have everything right.
Fatma!
Congratulations.
You're German now.
Fatma!
Well, my Hüseyin, don't hoop yourself like that.
We are still Turks.
Very nice.
Get up, get dressed. We have to go.
Today we will become Germans.
Come on, let's play soccer! Turks against Germans!
Yes! Oh yes!
Yes, I'll give it to you. He is also German.
Yes, he looks like that too.
He doesn't know Turkish yet. He doesn't know anything.
Fight! Fight!
Lara!
Yes, Mom?
- I'm going to grandma and grandpa's. - Yes, okay.
Hi, mom.
Sister-in-law! - They turned out so well!
Yes? - Great.
Cenk, don't forget the cake. - Yes, mom, quickly.
We have to prepare the table.
Oh, look, my boy! How was school today?
- What happened to your eye? - Nothing! Here, this is for you.
- Cenk, what happened to the eye? - Nothing!
My son, what happened to your eye?
Nothing!
A Turkish boy in his class teased him that he wasn't a real Turk.
What?
Ali! You go to school tomorrow...
and show this esol eşek what kind of Turks we are!
Dad!
My grandchild, not a real Turk, huh?
Hands off!
So delicious.
- How are you? - Fine.
Mom, why do you always have to make it so spicy, huh?
Then eat rice.
It's spicy too. It makes me sick to my stomach.
It must be Muhammed. Open the door.
Hello...
No, it's shit.
Hello, Muhammed.
Son, why are you so late? - I missed the bus, mom.
What happened to the eye? - Nothing!
Nothing...
You're doing it out of principle.
Family!
- I have surprise! - We are Germans now!
- What? - Germans?
- No way! - Madness!
No! This is not surprise!
Surprise is:
I bought house.
In Turkey, in village.
In-in homeland.
Why that? Do you want to return or what?
Look. This is our homeland.
- Nice, huh? - Huh?
That's where we're from?
So, I want us to go on vacation...
we all go to Turkey together.
The house is old and needs to be renovated.
It would be very good if you all helped.
We have other plans for the fall vacations, we can't.
Muhamed has nothing to do, he is unemployed.
Why don't you go down? I'll pay for the flight.
- Veli! What, it's true!
I pay all flights! - Well, great!
No way!
Yes, I would have no fun at all!
Enough! Quiet, damn it.
As your father, have I ever asked you for anything?
You just sit here and blah blah blah... Shame on you!
We are a family.
A Turkish family!
What are we now? Turks or Germans?
- Germans. - Turks.
Well, Dede and Nene have a German passport now.
It's a piece of paper!
We are still Turks! And you too!
Cenk, you can be both, like you.
No, it is not possible! Just one team or the other!
If grandma and grandpa are Turks, why they are here?
Well...
- Because the Germans called them. - Called them?
Yes, well, not only them, but also many other Turks and Italians and Yugoslavs and so on.
- They were all called. - Really?
Dear citizens of the world!
This is the Federal Republic of Germany!
We are looking for workers!
If you are young, strong and have a good work ethic,
then contact the nearest government office immediately!
And then, what happened?
You really want to hear the whole story?
Actually, it all started in a small village in southeastern Turkey. Here.
About where grandpa bought the house now.
It was a beautiful village in a small valley.
The people there lived a simple, quiet life.
They worked their fields.
Herded their cattle, and everything went on as usual.
Only one young man, named Grandpa,
lived through exciting times.
For he had his eye on the daughter of the village chief.
Not the fat one, the one in the middle. The beautiful one.
That was grandma.
Can't they all speak German?
Okay!
That means in German as much as:
No!
But Hüseyin didn't want to accept the no.
He kidnapped her.
At that time it was enough if a man even touched an unmarried woman.
It meant that this girl was dishonored.
What does dishonored mean?
Well, how to explain it?
Does it have something to do with sex?
Come on, let's catch the chickens! If you squeeze them hard enough, they'll lay an egg!
Really?
- Hey, hands off the chickens! - Go away!
Hey, Muhammed!
You sons of a donkey, how many times have I told you not to chase the poor chickens, eh?
They don't lay eggs because of all the excitement!
- We didn't do that. - Really, dad. - You have my word.
It was not easy to support a family of five at that time.
No matter how hard Hüseyin tried, it was barely enough to live on.
Look. Look what it says here.
What does it say? I can't read yet.
It says that Germany is still looking for workers.
One of my cousins has been working for a long time.
Sends home a big wad of cash every month.
He says,
that in one year he has saved so much money that they can buy a cab.
Take care of yourselves!
Like many other people at that time, Hüseyin also left his home country...
and came to Germany as a guest worker.
To Almanya, where everything was different.
Especially the language.
At least, one of them spoke Turkish.
Dear guest workers,
This day is an important day for all of us...
and we hope for a successful cooperation.
Are you counting the hours?
Do you feel the wind?
Soon the first leaves will fall.
Do you have sorrow too?
Don't cry my child.
For the roses bloom on the steel.
Foreign lands, foreign streets, foreign lights
And the hope of a little happiness.
Strange cities, strange people and faces
But one day he'll come back.
Papa! Papa!
Look.
Muhamed, Lela, how big you are already!
Don't you know me?
It's me.
Don't you know who that is? It's Dad!
Grandpa didn't plan to bring his whole family to Germany.
Oh, God, my headscarf!
So how did it happen?
- What?
He skipped school for twenty-one days in a row!
- Four! - Six!
Five and it's a deal.
Five and the rod?
Hey, what's the deal? That was a real deal!
I got cigarettes!
Oh, cigarettes! Come on, after him!
There must be a lack of discipline in the family!
I work day and night, and that so that the ones left behind will only become decent men,
You son of a donkey don't go to school?!
He will insult himself again!
Come, it does not stand, I break you!
I will take you all to Almanya.
Will teach you discipline and order. They are good at that, the Germans.
Then you will see what it means to skip school.
Is he serious, taking us all to Almanya?
No, of course not.
I can go further!
It's all arranged, we leave in a week.
What? What does it say?
Dear Mr. Yilmaz, we are pleased to inform you..,
that your application for family reunification has been approved.
So it was time to say goodbye.
Did you know that there is Coca-Cola everywhere in Germany?
Really?
Yes, they have masses of it!
When you get there, will you send me some?
I can't do that.
Why not?
How are you going to fit a bottle of Coke in an envelope?
Well, I'm glad we don't have to go there.
Why not?
They're all infidels there.
My brother said the Germans eat pork and people!
The sign is a dead man on the cross.
They ate him too.
Every Sunday they meet in a church and eat from him and drink his blood.
Really? They eat people?
Here, dear, it's supposed to be so cold in Germany.
Here, I knitted these myself, Germans are supposed to be so dirty.
This is from me. It's not much, but in Germany they say there's only potatoes.
Only potatoes?
The last night before they left for Almanya,
Grandma urged everyone to remember their dreams.
Because she believed that dreams could be glimpses into the future.
But that night, of all nights, no one could remember their dreams.
No one except Uncle Muhamed.
The rat! The rat ate my ear! Ah! My ear is bleeding!
Muhammed, Muhammed vomited.
You son of a donkey, what are you puking in the middle of the room, huh?
Look at the mess! Look!
What are you scolding the boy? He was frightened.
Come here, put on a new shirt.
What kind of men are you?
Goodbye, Leyla.
Bye, Leyla! Take care of yourself!
Why are they throwing water at them?
It's an old Turkish tradition.
When someone sets out on a long journey, people throw water at them as a farewell.
This means that this person should return just as quickly
as it takes for the water to evaporate.
It looks strange here, though.
It looks exactly the same here.
No, not at all! Just take a look!
It looks completely different here.
Well, we have to go.
I know, but it's late. Cenk has to go to school tomorrow.
Already?
But how did it look? What was different?
You will see soon.
Because we all go together. Grandpa bought a house...
and needs help from family.
And the whole family.
- We have to go then. - Yes, then we'll go too.
I have two appointments at home.
Of course.
Thank you.
Are you ready? Come on, spit it out.
What do you feel like doing?
Brave cutter or the Seven Ravens?
- Better that! - Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.
- Was Ali Baba actually also a Turk? - As brave as he was?
I'm sure he was.
Why can't I speak Turkish?
You know a little Turkish.
I can't come with you. I'm really sorry, but I have exams.
Exams, exams, exams...
The biggest test in life is..,
is knowing what's important and what's not.
Who knows when the next time
we can go on vacation as a whole family.
It's better if you come with us.
It will be very nice.
You'll see.
Don't they have any other hobbies? The wild young Turks.
There's the pill, after all, but they're probably too stupid with it, too.
Excuse me. You'll have to forgive us foreigners.
You know, when we hang around in the jungle all day like this, there's just nothing better to do.
All we can do is laze around and screw around! Yes!
Who's talking to you?
There are people who are happy to have children. Even if they are more than one and a half.
And?
Yes, I'm going to Turkey for the autumn vacations.
What?
Now? Why?
Is that even good in your condition?
David, I'm in my sixth week.
This thing isn't even the size of a gummy bear yet.
That's, I need time to teach this to my family.
They're gonna hate me.
Wife?
Jesus Christ!
Woman?
Woman, you must be getting old.
Didn't you hear the kettle whistle for hours?
And why did you buy green olives?
You know I only like the black ones.
But I like green olives.
I see. Are you dieting again?
I'm tired of eating black olives.
We've been eating black olives for 50 years.
This isn't about the color of the olives, is it?
Come on, say what's on your mind.
The house!
Why did you buy the house?
I told you I'm not going back to Turkey.
My place is with my children in Germany!
Who said we are going back?
We are not?
And the house?
A summer residence for vacations.
They taste terrible!
Hüseyin, look what we got in the mail. An invitation.
For immigrants. But we are Germans now.
"Germany says thank you..."
They want me to give a speech?
And in front of the Chancellor!
Have they gone crazy? There's no way I'm doing that!
God almighty! In front of Angela Merkel?
Wait, wait, this one's coming in. This... this one.
- Are you insane? - Why?
What's all this stuff?
You want to open a store in Turkey or what?
These are gifts!
I don't want you to go.
I can't just cancel it. I've tried, but...
I also need the time to tell my mother.
You don't know everything that can happen in Turkey! You have no idea!
Then I'll come with you to "Turkey". I am still now also family.
Nah, you're not.
These, these are important things.
I'm not going for the first time.
That's enough, that's enough!
You are the father of my embryo.
This is completely different.
Canan, we're having a baby. We are the family now. You, me and the baby!
Yes, but that doesn't make us a family. There's more to a family. There--there are aunts, uncles, grandparents.
There's a story.
Who's going to raise the child? Us or your family?
This will be the first trip with our German passports.
You're not happy about anything anymore.
This is terrible!
God almighty, do we have to do it now? We're going on vacation.
Should we go back to a dirty house?
Hurry up. The cab's here!
- Hurry up, quick! - I'm coming!
- Oh, four hours late! - Do they have to build the plane first, or what?
- Gabi! Four hours! - No way!
- I'm bored! - Do you... do you want to play something?
No, I want to hear the story, Canan!
Okay, um...
So...
They arrived in Germany and immediately it became clear that everything was different here.
The men here don't have mustaches.
See. They're all giants here.
Why is he stopping now?
- What?
A giant rat, some giant rats!
Where?
Hey, they'll eat us for sure!
That's not a rat, you blockhead. It's a dog!
Why doesn't it have real legs?
And why is the rat on a rope?
The Germans take their dogs for a walk. To do that, they put him on a rope.
- You take them for a walk? - Yes.
Can't they do it quietly by themselves?
They even let the animals sleep in their beds!
- People and animals in one bed? - Yes!
Almighty, help us.
Veli, come on!
This is our new home.
It's even naked!
This is our own toilet.
And what's that funny chair?
This is a German toilet. You sit on it.
- With your butt on it? - On it.
Nobody goes on it until I clean it.
Who knows what kind of diseases the Germans have.
God almighty, help us.
This is the nursery.
The three of us are supposed to sleep in there?
I'm not sleeping in the same bed with him! Ouch!
That one happens to be your brother, right? Your flesh and blood.
Clean up, I have to pee.
I'm cleaning up the Germans' shit...
and this is too slow?
- But I have to pee! - Go to the back of the house!
What is it?
- What's that? - This is Jesus.
- That's what Christians worship. - Take it away!
Take it away!
A wooden figurine. They worship a wooden figure?
Almighty, what a thing there is!
Can you leave that?
- You've got a lot more ceiling than that! - No, I don't!
You're so fat, you don't need a blanket.
Watch out!
Hüseyin, please do the shopping tomorrow, we have no bread left.
When I come back from work, the stores will be closed, you have to do it.
Are you crazy?
You can't send me there alone!
All right, but what can I say? I don't know their language yet!
Yes, then it's time you learned it.
These donkey-sons. Wait, I'll show you!
Daddy's coming!
You retards, I have to get up at six!
If I hear another peep out of you, I'll beat you two savages soft. Do you hear me?
This is all your fault, you moron!
Me? Who asked you, you fool!
You're bringing us here now!
If you hadn't skipped school once, we'd all still be at home!
Shh, dad will be back soon!
I would like a bread.
Bread!
Bread!
No way!
Bread, bread!
Does not have bread then. Do you have milk?
Milk! Milk!
Almighty, you know milk!
It's 8 o'clock!
There, there it is!
Here! Here we are!
When I grow up, I'll be a garbageman!
You're a girl, you can't be a garbage man!
I can!
You can't! It's called garbage man, not garbage woman.
I'm still going to be a garbage man.
Only a few weeks after their arrival, and without speaking a single word of German,
all the children started school.
Aunt Lela was the first to learn the language and was used as an interpreter everywhere.
What did she say? I've got something bad, haven't I?
Say it!
You're going to have a baby!
A baby?
Christ almighty, another baby!
They're here, they're here!
There he is, the first German. Looks like one too.
Real ugly!
- Was he really that ugly? - Of course! Look at him!
It is ugly!
It's here at last!
I'll get it.
Wait here.
Can you please take a look at this?
It says here that you are invited to a reception in Bellevue Palace!
- What? - Under the motto, Germany says thank you?
Crass! It says here that the Chancellor will be present!
You may be happy, if you as a one million hundredth
Gastarbeiter would say something to others.
- Is not true. - Yes! Look!
I don't believe it.
Dede will speak in front of the whole nation!
- I won't say anything! - But why?
I will go there. I know exactly what I'm going to tell them!
Nobody will care what you have to say! Dad's invited, not you!
Hold your breath.
Shut up, all of you!
- I'm not going, that's it! - He will be on television!
Nene and Dede will be famous in their old days!
What, me? Nothing on TV!
Well, then, um, I'll go.
