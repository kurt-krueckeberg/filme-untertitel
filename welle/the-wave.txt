Good morning.
Good morning.
Yes, and always make sure that the kiddies don't smoke in the schoolyard, right?
Hello, my darling.
Well, my rocker?
We teachers are lazy, don't mess up our image.
I just have to copy some worksheets.
Have you been to Kohlhage?
No, why?
Oh, she asked for you.
Then I will go there.
Autocracy? I thought it was a very clear thing that I will do the Anarchy course.
Dieter Wieland has just presented me his concept.
He has already worked out his whole week perfectly, so...
I would have sat down now on the weekend.
Yes, a bit late.
Wieland, Wieland has absolutely no idea about the subject.
I studied in Berlin, I lived five years in the last house in Kreuzberg.
May 1st, always there. So who is better suited than me?
If it means so much to you, then ask Mr. Wieland if he would trade places with you.
Can you not again ...
Settle this among yourselves.
Mr. Wieland.
Mr Wenger.
It's about the topic during the Project Week.
Yes, and?
I want to ask you, if you can swap with me?
I have Autocracy.
Alea iacta est.
The die is cast.
You know very well that I would have liked to do anarchy.
Too much it seems to me.
The project week is about teaching the students about the benefits of democracy.
How to mix Molotov cocktails...belongs in chemistry class at best.
Have a nice day.
I loved you,...you betrayed me.
But the dream of life, of love,
of trust,...this once real dream I haven't forgotten.
I want to build it with my billions,...change the past by destroying you.
Sweetheart!
I thank you for the flower bushes.
Make something when I'm in the box.
Yodeling apostle.
Not true? "You knew."
I'll take you to Capri in your coffin.
Wait, he says something completely different.
But I want to say so now.
Man Ferdi, we wanted to get through to the end for once, without interruption, right?
But you have stopped.
Supreme theater rule, Karo:
"Keep on playing".
Dennis, you wanted to transfer the criticism of capitalism...from the play to globalization today.
Yes, and that's why I'm bringing the text a bit more up to date.
Contemporary is all right, but not so silly.
It can't catch on.
Yes, after all we are playing Dürrenmatt (the playwright),
and not the bull**** Comedy Club.
Thank you for the wreaths,
the chrysanthemums and roses.
Noble.
Hey, that sounds like total crap!
Excuse me, that's definitely not how I say it.
You can forget that.
It's simple, if Ferdi doesn't stick to his cues... then I can't play it either.
He's still a boy.
Oh man, I don't feel like it anymore.
I'm going now, are you coming?
It would be better if...
if the piece is played much more seriously.
Yeah, it just doesn't make sense if everyone does what they want.
Are you coming to the game today?
Lisa and I have to study for Spanish.
You've got the whole afternoon.
Well, where did you sign up?
Signed up?
Yes, for the project week.
Are the lists up yet?
Sure.
I want to do Autocracy.
Yes, cool, I am there too.
I need to...
Will you put me down too?
Where?
Wherever you are.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
See you soon.
Now grit your teeth one more time, okay?
I want to see a real,
aggressive game.
Watch your defense and cover for a counterattack, okay?
That it's clear, we have now 8 minutes,
we can do it, okay?
Marco. Marco, that counts for you too.
Yes, play together.
Yes, watch your defense.
And stick together, play together.
Okay? 8 minutes left.
One more time through, now come, come, go.
Watch out!
Nice, nice forward now!
Nice, Marco!
Pass it! Pass it!
Sinan is free!
- Marco, I am free!
- Have some guts.
What the hell are you doing!
Sinan was free!
...to give away, or what?
What's wrong with you?
Martin, now you tell me, right?
Tell me, what is there to rebel against nowadays?
Everything has no value anymore, right?
Everyone has only his...
His own pleasure in his head.
What our generation is missing... is a common goal which welds us together.
That's the zeitgeist, now look around you.
The most googled person in the internet is who?
Paris "****ing" Hilton.
- Oh, shit.
- No shit.
Hey, let it out.
It's gonna be okay.
Stolti.
And Stolti, do you have the dope today?
Yes, of course.
And this is real, yes?
Of course,... a colleague of mine got it from Holland yesterday.
Are you soft in the head, running around with so much weed?
The cops should catch me first.
What do you want for it?
Nothing.
- What do you want?
- I'll give it to you.
You're my homies.
Monday, baby!
The water is totally awesome,
probably 16 degrees.
Don't you want to swim a bit?
It'll do you good.
Maybe later.
How's your shoulder?
It's fine.
Mustn't overload it, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Want some coffee?
Yeah. Thanks.
Good morning.
Is there anything for free here?
- Everything fresh, Rainer?
- I hope so.
- Good morning, Rainer.
- Sinan.
Honestly, I'm a bit surprised... that so many are interested in the topic of autocracy.
I would have preferred Anarchy in your place.
With "old" Wieland?
That's what you said.
Alright...
Autocracy, what is it?
Come on, you have chosen the topic.
You must have expected something from it.
Well, hopefully no stress.
Seriously, what do you mean by autocratic forms of government?
Something like monarchy, maybe?
Not necessarily.
Ferdi, can you think of something?
These are car races in craters.
But that was really a very economical one.
Dictatorship perhaps?
Among other things, yes. Karo?
I think autocracy is when an individual... or a group rules over the masses.
Exactly.
Autocracy is derived from the Greek... ...and means self-rule.
So, "Auto" from self and "Kratia"...
from rule, power.
In an autocracy, an individual or a group that provides the government...
has so much power that they can change the laws as they wish.
Do you have examples of such systems?
Come on, some dictatorship will come to your mind.
Third Reich.
Ah no, not again.
Well, I didn't choose this topic... but we have to get through the week somehow.
I've printed out some notes for you.
Don't go through that shit again.
Oh man, but it's an important topic.
Nazi Germany was shit.
Slowly I got it too."
Exactly, ****ing Nazis!
- It doesn't happen here like that anymore anyway.
- Oh yeah, and the neo-Nazis?
We can't keep feeling guilty for something we didn't do.
It's not about guilt... It's about the fact that we have a certain responsibility with our history.
Well, I am a Turk!
Yes, responsibility of course, but I mean everybody knows that.
What does everybody know?
Well, maybe not a few crazy East Germans, but...
What does that mean?
I'm from the East too.
Yes you know what I mean, here skin heads.
Rainer, can't we please do something else?
- What?
- Let's talk about the Bush government.
Wait a minute, I just find it interesting.
So you are of the opinion that dictatorship would no longer be possible in Germany, yes?
No way, we are much too enlightened for that.
Marco, what do you think?
I don't know.
Well, we'll take a break for ten minutes.
What's going on here?
We rearranged the tables,
so at least there's room for everyone.
Bring your table to the back.
Maybe we can organize the project week the way we want.
I suggest we loosen it up a bit.
Any objections?
Very well.
What is the fundamental (basic) prerequsites (preconditions) requirement for an autocratic system?
Dennis?
An ideology.
Yes, what else?
Control.
Surveillance.
You're thinking a little too far ahead.
Dissatisfaction.
Interesting.
But what I mean is: What does every dictatorship have?
We talked about it earlier.
A leader, man.
A leader?
Yes, Führer is a bit loaded now.
But every dictatorship has a central figure.
Let's play through the whole thing.
So who could that be here with us?
As a teacher, you, of course.
- Me?
- Who else?
Well, I thought maybe one of you would like to set the tone.
I'll do it, I'll be your leader.
Forget it.
Rainer, you do it.
Okay, so we vote.
Who is for me being your leader during the project week.
- And what is the point of that?
- Just wait and see.
Or in other words, who is against?
Against?
Abstention?
Good.
Hail Rainer!
Such a leading figure deserves respect, of course.
That's why I would like you to address me as Mr Wenger during the whole time.
Mr Wenger.
Now he is becoming megalomaniac.
Hey, we just voted, didn't we?
What do you want from me, Easterner?
Just participate.
I won't let you tell me anything.
Watch your mouth, asshole.
Now please be quiet. Come on, take all the stuff from your tables. Everything.
And from now on, only the one I give the floor will speak.
Yes, Mr Wenger.
Did I give you the floor.
No.
And one more thing, everyone who is speaking must also stand up.
Aren't you going a bit too far?
Mona.
Aren't you going a bit too far...  Mr Wenger?
Do you feel something?
Do you feel what?
Getting up spontaneously gets your blood circulation going.
You know how it is when your heart rate drops.
But when you stand up then you are not so tired and much more concentrated.
You can sit down again.
Marco, I know you are tired from training... but sit up straight.
Stretch your spine,
put your feet parallel... and take a deep breath.
Do you feel anything?
Yes.
Marco?
Yes, Mr Wenger, I can breath bettecan breathe better.
Exactly, you get better air.
Then let's all do it now.
So, everybody stand up, please.
Stand up together, come on.
What's going on now?
And take a deep breath.
Come on, stand up, all of you.
Breathe in... and exhale.
- And what about you?
- Not in the mood.
Then you have to leave.
I'm not forcing anyone, by the way, that goes for everyone.
The whole thing here is voluntary.
- Now stay cool, Rainer.
- Mr Wenger.
Kevin, this is very simple... ...either you participate or you leave.
So?
Come on men, this is too "cranky" for me.
Come Sinan.
Bomber.
Bye bye!
You can sit down again.
What else is important in a dictatorship?
Discipline, Mr Wenger.
Very good, Tintin.
Power through discipline.
Let's play a game of billiards.
No... ...I know something better.
Dude, what is this?
I thought you were here with M-Class?
This is my mother's car, my father gave it to her for her wedding anniversary.
V8, 190 kW, 240 top speed.
Let's take this baby out for a spin, shall we?
What about you?
No, I'm not coming.
What do you mean you're not coming?
Well, I'm going back to class.
Are you off duty or what?
Dude, I got caught twice already.
Do you know what happens if I don't pass my exams?
And it's not going well for you either.
I think it's very good that you have decided differently.
Please sit in the back.
Thanks to you Rai..., Mr Wenger.
We were just at the question:
Which social structures favor the emergence of a dictatorship?
Lisa?
So, which social structures are necessary?
So, if there is so much injustice and...
And people just don't know if they...
So a social...
Hey Ferdi, what is this?
Lisa, just sit down again.
Take a deep breath,...think about your answer before and do it concisely.
I know you can do it.
Try again, okay?
High unemployment and social injustice.
That's right, high unemployment and social injustice... certainly favors the emergence of a dictatorship.
Tim?
High inflation, Mr Wenger.
Good, inflation.
Political disenchantment.
Very good, Karo.
National consciousness.
I mean, we all saw it at the World Cup... when suddenly everywhere the German flags were hung out.
- It was great.
- I found it totally disgusting.
Yes, that was exactly what was cool about the World Cup.
If the Germans can't finally be proud of their country again... like every other nation...
Then this leads only to the opposite.
This create hatred for everything else.
I think what Mona means is something like extreme nationalism.
Can we agree on that?
Good.
Mr Wenger?
After class you can call me Rainer again.
It was really fun for me today.
I also think it was great how you participated, keep it up.
Yes... Mr Wenger!
Man, be careful!
Watch out.
Watch it yourself.
Don't be so cheeky to your sister.
What do you want, better give us a light.
You're not allowed to smoke.
My father gave me permission.
Here, I have.
Torsten may have said that it's your business... but he certainly didn't give you permission.
At least not your business.
Come on, let the weirdo.
- Retard.
- You're a retard.
Don't you have your own home?
Hi, sweetie!
Hello, sweetie.
Do you want a drink?
Yes.
Aren't you going to ask me how it went?
How did it go?
Well, it was very interesting.
Mr Wenger showed us how to sit properly.
So, upright with pressed spine and so...
You know how it is when you stand up so quickly and then it flickers in front of your eyes.
That's because your pulse is down.
Another roast?
Now we always have to stand up when we want to say something.
That's good for the blood circulation.
And our answer must always be short and to the point.
Very nice and why don't you stick to it then?
All of us were suddenly fully involved,
it was like this incredible energy... that carried everyone along.
Eerie is exactly the right expression.
What does that mean now?
Power through discipline.
Karo, honey, I don't know.
We didn't raise you like this.
You should have.
A little discipline wouldn't have hurt Leon.
Your brother should learn his own limits.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work for everyone.
How?
Kevin, for example. I had to kick him out today.
And for that I'll ram you away, you wanker!
Dude, now calm down.
Rainer is cool.
Now stab me in the back, you traitor.
I would have kicked you out too.
Besides, Rainer did not kick you out, but Mr Wenger did.
He never liked me... ...because I don't play in his gay water polo team.
What are you guys actually doing?
We are training really hard.
I don't know why it doesn't work.
But we have to win against this Ernst Barlach Gesamtschule (comprehensive school) again... otherwise, it'll be really tight to stay in the league.
Come by again sometime.
When are you playing next time?
Come Marco, let's go to my room.
We wanted to finish watching the stage(of the bike race) here.
Yes, we can do that with me, too.
Besides, we also have to prepare the project week.
What do you mean?
Can you please come?
Sorry, Torsten.
Well, then you study for your project week.
Well, my little honey bee.
Shall we both do a little project week?
I thought we were doing something else?
Look, what do you think?
That's where we're going.
Gracia is the hippest neighborhood in Barcelona.
It's only seven stops from the stadium.
Isn't it a bit far?
Seven stations?
Barcelona.
It's nice, right by the sea, a city of artists.
Don't you think your family will miss you?
They all get on my nerves at the moment anyway.
Torsten, Biene (Karo's mother) are super cool.
Yes, but maybe they are sometimes too cool for me.
Now leave that shit.
Come here.
I not in the mood now.
Aren't you flying tomorrow or what? There's still time.
No, but I have to sign up soon.
Then sign up.
Come on, stay a little longer.
I have to go to training.
Wait, wait, come here.
Man, what kind of shit is that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Damn it, you can't do what you want here.
When are you gonna get that?
Listen, man.
Leave me alone.
Listen, let's play together for once, okay?
Everyone thinks you're going it alone anyway.
I'll break left and then double-pass, okay?
- Okay?
- Yes.
Out, out, you go in, yes.
Yes Marco, that's nice!
That's a move, class!
Finally!
Hello, my sweetie, I am back.
What is going on with you?
Just a moment, I have to print out something, okay?
Kiki and Alex are really exhausting in the long run, a real teacher couple.
Are we both like that?
Tell me, what is all this?
Just a few ideas I'd like to try out tomorrow.
Then I know something.
If you have your nurse costume with you.
Let's see.
Do you need a syringe?
- I have a small syringe for you.
- I see.
It's loaded.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Yeah, let's go!
(Tuesday)
Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr Wenger!
You don't take me seriously, do you?
Yes, of course.
Everybody stand up please.
Four times.
These are some relaxation exercises.
To loosen up the muscles.
Especially the legs, please.
So, and now in step.
Left, right, left, right...
And what is this?
Just follow me, I want to show you something.
Yes, very good.
Do you feel that?
How we all slowly merge into one!
That is the power of community!
How long do we have to go on?
Until we are all absolutely in the same rhythm.
You know this from dancing, Mona.
Left, right, left...
Come on, one, two...
With such vibrations you can even make bridges collapse.
- Kaschi, you're throwing me off my rhythm.
- Shut up, okay.
I think we're getting the hang of it,
...Mr Wenger.
I don't think so.
This exercise has another purpose.
Which one?
Beneath us is the anarchy course of Wieland!
And I want the plaster from the ceiling to fall down on our enemies!
Tempo!
Have they gone mad?
Power through discipline power through community.
You surely all ask why I have moved you.
I would like to break up the usual cliques.
You all have friends and groups with whom you get along well, that is also important.
You can't get through life alone...but together then we would be much, much stronger.
The new seating arrangement is subject to a certain system...do you have any idea what it is?
No one?
Karo, why do you think you are no longer sitting next to Marco but next to Jens?
Maybe because Marco and I are distracting each other.
Aha, do you?
Wieland down there educates his students to be lone fighters...and believes that better performance will come out of it.
You all know that. Nobody is allowed to copy, competitive thinking.
I think this creates an dog-eat-dog society...and I am firmly convinced that if we help each other...
...then we are much, much stronger.
Does this mean that we can all copy (each other's work), or what?
If it means that you will have better grades in the end, yes.
That's why I always put a student with a bad grade...next to one with a good grade in my class.
I want you to help each other.
That's total bullshit.
- Mona? -
- Yes, really unbelievable.
Stand up, please.
I can't believe we're making people look like fools.
All the bad students are sitting here now like their on display.
Mona, I never said anything about bad students...only about bad grades.
For me there are no bad students.
For example, you are very good in my class but you are weak in math, right?
Well, Lisa is a straight A in math.
You could help each other.
There's another advantage to this whole thing.
We'd just look a lot..,
much better as a class... at least better than the anarchies among us!
I know, the whole thing sounds a bit unusual...but why shouldn't we try something new?
Hey Domi, was quite loud, right?
And what's up with you, with Wieland our old Bavarian „asylum seeker"?
I thought anarchy is somehow a bit interesting but... the guy doesn't work at all.
He is such a sleeping pill,
tell you... if you had not made the alarm sound up there, then I would have fallen asleep.
What was that all about?
That was just some relaxation exercises to wake me up,
nothing more.
Loosening up?
It sounded like the school building was going to collapse.
You're disrupting my class.
My students are outraged, and rightly so.
Can I help you?
Yes, we wanted to ask if we can change to the Autocracy course.
But as soon as possible.
We had stopped at community.
By what can you recognize community?
By the sense of community, Mr Wenger.
Yes, that's right, but I mean more visually.
Lisa?
By the clothes, Mr Wenger.
Exactly, by a common way of dressing.
You could also say uniformity.
Yes, but uniforms suck.
Dominik.
Well, I mean uniforms are totally fascist.
I don't necessarily mean military uniforms.
There are uniforms everywhere,... in supermarkets, at Mc Donald's,
stewardesses, meter maids,... even suits are a dress code.
Or what you're wearing,
isn't that also a kind of uniform?
You also belong to a group with it,
don't you?
Lisa?
Yes, but uniforms also serve another purpose.
Because they eliminate social differences.
Yes, but they also eliminate any individuality.
Mona, please stand up.
Lisa, explain it again in more detail.
Well, I mean... we all stress ourselves out every morning with what to wear.
That wouldn't be necessary at all if we all wore the same uniform.
Karo?
I heard that in Hamburg they are discussing whether to reintroduce school uniforms.
Does that make sense?
Sinan?
Yes of course, but it would have to be cheap,
so that everyone can afford them.
Marco, you can tell us that too.
Stephon Marbury, from New York Knicks,
he has developed a basketball shoe for $ 14.99.
The "Starbury One".
Yeah, he's from the ghetto himself and he just wanted...kids to be able to afford shoes and not have to buy the overpriced Nike Air.
That's a good example, how can he throw them on the market so cheap?
Because they are produced in the labor camps in China?
No, they just don't put that much money into advertising.
Nike spends hundreds of millions on advertising.
Beckham got zig millions from Adidas.
What do you think if we introduce some kind of... school uniform during the whole project week?
What?
What kind of uniform?
I don't know, a simple pair of jeans,
a white shirt, everybody has that.
- I don't have a white shirt.
- Well, then you buy one.
Please, I mean, I'm not gonna spend money on that.
Come on, it doesn't cost anything.
Jens, stand up please.
Well, I have two white shirts at home.
You could have one of them.
That's what I call team spirit, Jens.
Very good.
Then we'll do it like this.
- Two times the same shirt.
- Correct.
I just sold a white one.
110, please.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Your receipt?
- Nah, nah, it's fine, thanks.
- Okay, bye.
- Hello!
- Hello!
They're in fashion now, aren't they?
45, please.
Excuse me, but maybe my stuff is here too.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
You look like a convent girl.
Well, I like it.
Wednesday. Where's your white shirt?
I don't feel like it.
Why not?
White doesn't suit me.
So it does.
Again 'ne thing of vanity.
I don't have to justify myself just because of such a shitty shirt.
You see, this is exactly what Mr Wenger means,...that is selfish.
Karo, we have told you that we are all in this together.
Leave me alone!
White doesn't suit her.
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Mona changed classes, but we got some new students.
Sit down somewhere where you can still find room.
Now we are finally full.
But Jules Baumann and Frederick Claussen..,
they also wanted to join us.
Unfortunately, full is full.
Dennis?
But now that there are so many of us, we definitely need a name, don't we?
Very good, that would have been my next point,
do you have any suggestions?
Sinan?
Terror Squad.
Serious ones, please.
Dennis?
Club of visionaries.
Marco?
The Wave.
Had to come from you.
- That is great, isn't it? It fits.
- Right.
Tim?
Tsunami.
A bit thick.
Kashi?
The base.
The pact.
The white giant.
The inner circle.
The risen ones.
The center.
Center, also good.
Anybody else have any ideas?
No one?
Karo?
The changers?
The changers.
Good, then we have collected a lot.
I'll write down a few names.
Club of visionaries,...Basis.
So, that brings us to the last suggestion.
The Changemakers.
With this the result is fixed.
From now on we are called "The Wave".
This is really good.
I can listen better in this, really.
No, really, that's good.
Maybe you should make our logo.
- Yes?
- Yeah. Okay, you do our logo.
That takes us to the next stage:
Power through action.
What good are all the good ideas if you sit on your butts and don't act on them?
I want you to give all your creativity to The Wave,...for the whole community.
Yes, okay, then I will make us a profile on MySpace.
- Great!
- I wanted to do that already.
You can do it together.
No, then I'll do something of my own.
Look, then just build a homepage.
Well and if Sinan makes us the logo then we can also make buttons.
My aunt has a machine for that.
We could make tattoos,
here so on the arm.
Postcards that we then ...
And we make guardians.
Hey, what's up, dude?
Listen, a buddy of mine is on the wagon right now.
Man, I hear you're getting high.
I'll pay for it, too, man.
Go to the station.
What's going on back there?
They're screwing with Stoltefuss, what else?
There's nothing for anarchists like you.
What's that?
What's that fancy shirt you're wearing?
Your mother bought you?
Leave me alone, you jerks!
Hey, take it easy.
Is there a problem here, or what?
Two more of them.
What's up?
You got some gang thing going on, huh?
If you don't leave Tim alone, I'll smack you, understand?
It's ok.
You fascist assholes!
Anarchy jerks tore my shirt.
You can't let Assis push you around like that.
But you were there.
But we are not always there.
Hey Tim, I'll give you my number, okay?
If the hustlers make trouble again so,
you call me, okay?
Yes.
What was going on earlier?
I don't know, she's pissed.
She's like that now. She won't let me get close to her.
I've noticed that lately.
Sometimes I'm annoyed by her controlling manner.
She makes her plans and doesn't listen to what I actually want or...
Why should I come to Spain at all?
In ten months when I'm there she'll already have some Juan or Miguel or whatever.
I'm really scared of losing her.
Karo, it's Dennis, where are you?
We're all just waiting for you, it's total chaos,...so please call us when you get this, okay?
- Voicemail.
- That's what I said.
But she knows we want to rehearse today.
It's not that big a loss.
She's probably pissed off because we didn't vote for her proposal "the change" today.
Anyway, I have better things to do than waiting for a princess all day.
I'm coming with you.
Now wait a minute.
Lisa, I'm leaving now, this is getting too stupid for me.
If you leave now, we can forget the whole play!
Is that what you want?
I know we can put on something really great here.
A good play, which is about something.
That not only entertains but also has a message.
But we can't do it without Karo.
Yes, you wanted her to play the role!
I was against this stupid vote from the beginning!
I also wanted us to do something like an audition.
We never voted anyway.
Can I now once briefly have peace!
Now let's please do it the way I want, just once!
Maja, this is your chance.
You play Claire Zachanassian.
- Cool.
- And Lisa, you take over the part of Maja.
Me?
Yeah, you know the lines anyway,
so now dare yourself.
And Ferdi, please stick to the text and don't make a comedy act out of it, okay?
Yes, sir!
Dude, I'm glad that the day is over.
But Rainer has really done correct things with us.
No shit, you should participate again.
The Wave needs you, man.
Does it look like I'm going to be a casserole now?
Screw it,...
...you don't have to go to class with us.
Just go along with it.
Hey, let us try!
What do you want?
Skateboarding, man, what else?
Isn't that that "bitch" Caro's brother?
Do you mind?
Your sister's a cunt!
Tell me something new.
The pipe belongs to The Wave.
If you want to skate here, you have to become a member first.
You sit for the last time in the wild forest full of cuckoo and wind noise.
Tonight the community gathers.
Dennis thinks I was even really good.
You betrayed me.
So Maja is playing my part now?
...the dream of life...
Yeah, that was just to try it out.
...the once real dream...
Why didn't you come?
...I haven't forgotten.
I just wasn't feeling well.
Thank you for the wreaths,
the chrysanthemums and roses.
And suddenly Ferdi sticks to the text, right?
Yes, Dennis finally put his foot down. 
Have you all conspired against me now with your white shirts?
Nonsense.
But now that I'm not here anymore, it's working.
Caro, you're just mad because we didn't take your suggestion this morning.
What?
Don't you see how you get on everyone's nerves with your authoritative manner.
Are you crazy or what?
Have you ever thought about the fact that Marco doesn't want to follow you to Spain?
Why do you think that?
Because he told you.
Oh, he told you that, did he?
Anything else, how often we have sex?
You're so full of shit, you know that?
I'm shit, yeah?
I'd like to see you when I talk to your boyfriend about your relationship problems.
But I don't have relationship problems because I don't have a relationship.
And I don't have a boyfriend either, in case you haven't noticed.
But it's always about you anyway.
You know what? Maja was really good today.
Much better than you.
But you don't care about the role anyway.
You are just so pissed off because zour not top dog in the Wave.
It's a shitty feeling, isn't it?
Get used to it.
- Well?
- Hi.
Wait a minute, I want to show you something.
- Here.
- What's this?
You know what Kaschi is, right?
He made a page on myspace this afternoon,
and we're already online.
- That's cool.
- Super cool.
Honey?
Yes.
Kaschi is totally motivated.
The kids are going through a real change.
Sure. You can see that.
You with your white shirts.
Yeah, okay, I forgot to change.
They're already talking about you at school.
I don't give a damn, they always have.
But since when do you care?
I'm just saying.
- That's our sign.
- Cool.
Like a wave we will roll over the whole city!
On a wall it looks really "rad", men. Respect!
What's he doing here?
What's up with you, you jerk?
You can be glad that you can come with us today.
Hey, calm down!
The Wave is a movement,...everyone can join who feels connected to the cause.
No, Tim is right.
Kevin did not want to join from the beginning,
Why now all of a sudden?
Don't make such a fuss.
Kevin has had 5000 stickers printed.
That shows that he is a worthy Wave member.
Yes, sponsored by Daddy.
I think Mr Wenger should decide whether he is still allowed to join or not.
Mr Wenger told us something about community.
Only together we are strong.
I don't know what you guys are up to ...but Mr Wenger would surely have a problem with us tagging whole city.
Yes, I also think that you are taking this thing a bit too seriously, yes?
I mean, we want to have fun, right?
So.
So pack up your stuff and let's go, right?
Do you have all the stickers?
Here take the stencil.
I've got five of them.
- Let's go!
- Can we get a ride with you?
Come with me in the car, we're going!
What's going on here?
Are you crazy?
Guys, wait a minute.
What's going on?
Let's cross the shit from the Anarchy ******.
In any case...
Don't worry so much,
she could have come with us.
- Speak of the devil.
- Well, don't answer it now.
You're making yourself totally uninteresting
if you're always available.
Believe me, I'm a girl,
I know what makes us tick.
Come on, Marco!
Dude, you know what would be fat?
If we spray the Wave up there.
How cool will that be?
Let's piss off.
I'll do it.
What?
I'm climbing up there.
Dude, cut the shit!
Forget it man, we gotta get out of here.
Give me your phone.
- Does it have video?
- Yeah, it's got video.
Hey, this guy's a psycho.
Totally.
The other day he filmed his sister ****ing.
He doesn't have a sister.
What does he have?
I know Stoltefuss from before.
In the youth camp, he drank himself into a coma on the very first day.
He has an older brother.
Some computer brain at the university.
But no sister.
Tim, man!
Don't mess around!
Shit, guys!
The cops!
Thursday, Mom!
It's a mess!
Cool, dude, no shit!
I would not have dared to do that.
I shit my pants when I have to jump from the triple.
Oh well, so heights don't bother me.
- Here, guys.
- Thanks, guys.
No, only for Wave members.
What?
Just kidding, here, take it.
Stick your crappy ice cream in your ass,
You bum!
I'm in.
Hey, you know what the terms of admission are, right?
Don't listen to him.
Hey Turk, you have a pretty big face in your white shirt.
Hey guys,...what do you think of this?
Very chill greeting for The Wave.
Very relaxed.
As our greeting or what?
Of course, all possible groups have their own greeting. Black Power!
- West Coast!
- East Coast, dude!
That's Eminem.
Nah, it's Eminem.
- Hang Loose.
- Or Satan.
Yeah, even the Vulcan.
It's nice.
How was that?
So like that?
Not high at the end. Under the chest, here.
Let's do it together.
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr Wenger!
You can sit down again.
So, power through action was the last thing yesterday.
- Piss off, we won't let you in!
- Why not?
Because you don't belong to The Wave.
Leon!
What's going on here?
They don't want to let me pass.
What's up with you? Are you crazy or what?
We will let you in only if you do the salute.
What kind of greeting anyway?
Good morning, Mr Wenger.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Karo, I missed you in class.
- Do you have time?
- Yes.
And could you do anything?
I gave him a shit, what else?
Oh, that's good. I will have a look at your brother too.
And The Wave?
What about it?
Do you just want to let it go on like that?
Do you want to give up everything because of that?
It is only one more day, we will do it together.
I don't mind if you don't wear a white shirt.
I'm sorry Rainer,...but I think you don't have the whole thing under control anymore, not at all.
Well, then you have to change the course!
Everything okay with you?
And here like this?
I thought you didn't give a shit about that.
Mr Wenger, do you have a moment?
In my room.
Yes, of course.
Doctor Kohlhage, believe me.., ...I have a pedagogical goal.
You should see how the students are coming out of their shells.
- They're really highly motivated.
- I know that.
I just wanted to tell you that Mr. Westerhofen called me.
Jens is transformed, he speaks highly of you.
I didn't want to tell you so directly in the teachers' lounge.
You know, some of your colleagues... have a problem with your kind, but...
...you have my support.
I think it's good.
The next issue of the school newspaper is already completely laid out,...nothing more can go in.
Yes, it probably takes too long, anyway.
We have to send out an e-mail to all the students.
You have the addresses, right?
We can't do that, data protection.
Who gives a shit?
So, I'll help you.
Honestly,...for my taste you make too big a fuss about this thing.
Yeah, but do you just want to sit around and do nothing, or what?
No, I want to go to Kaschi.
Lan party.
Lan party.
Oh God!
Don't lose it, okay?
I signed for it.
Hey, you guys got your asses handed to you?
- Are those the guys?
- Yes.
So you are The Wave fascists, right?
Wave fascists?
Are you damaged?
Stupid Mr Wenger has shit in all of your brains.
Hey, how come you spray our sign?
I don't know what you are talking about, you hustler!
Tim, are you stupid?
Tim!
Tim!
Don't mess around, dude.
Run for your life or I will blow your brains out!
It's alright.
It's okay, it's okay.
Tim?
Hey, they're gone, it's okay, put the gun down.
Are you out of your mind?
How can you walk around with a gun?
It's just a gas gun, take it easy.
I got it from the Internet, it's very easy.
The end justifies the means.
- But that's not true... I didn't write that they beat up the kid.
We want to shake things up, right?
Michael Moore does it the same way.
I'll stick with the truth.
Great, we might as well not do it.
Yes?
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're having a little beach party tonight,
Are you coming?
We? You mean Wave members.
Yes, a couple of them will be there.
No thanks, without white shirt I am not wanted there anyway.
It is stupid.
Yes, it is stupid and that's exactly why I don't feel like it!
Oh, "Bad vibrations", I think,
I think I'd better go.
You can stay here.
No, I have choir rehearsal anyway.
And have fun at The Wave party.
- Bye.
- Ciao.
What do you actually have against The Wave?
Marco, man, open your eyes.
The Wave is becoming a really strange thing.
You are obsessing about something.
Oh, yeah? Then take a look at this.
Just look at the way the page looks.
Yes, Tim made it.
He likes to overshoot the mark. 
Here...(pointing to a comment posted on the webpage of Die Welle by someone who feels intimidated by the Wave)
"Yesterday, a guy in a white shirt came at me from the side...
...like, I don't join The Wave, I will lose all my friends,...because soon they will all be part of it.
I just said that I would think about it.
And he (said), very beligerently, if it is not too late".
Too late for what, Marco?
Don't you realize what's going on here?
Here students are put under pressure.
Yes, but the entry is posted anonymously.
- How do you know it's not a fake?
- A fake?
Leon didn't let a little boy from the sixth grade into the school just because he didn't want to do your stupid Wave greeting.
I am sorry but your brother has always been stupid.
But not like this...and I am also treated like a leper merely because I don't wear a white shirt.
Why don't you just wear it?
Quite simply because I don't want to.
But I want to, because The Wave means something to me.
What does it mean?
Community.
You might know it, you have a family of your own.  I don't.
Are you coming or not?
Can I help them?
What are you doing here?
I have to protect them.
You what?
I want to be their bodyguard.
What would I do with a bodyguard?
Tim, go home.
What should I do there?
Nobody is interested in me anyway.
So, if you have problems, you can come to me... but I don't need a bodyguard, okay?
Come with me.
- Hi, honey!
- Hello!
And what did Kohlhage want?
Hello, Tim.
Hello, Mrs Wenger.
- Rainer, can talk to you for a moment.
- Yes, sure.
What is this?
It wasn't my idea, I didn't invite him. He suddenly stood there.
He has no one at home to take care of him.
I imagined it differently.
Let's have dinner now, then I will send him home, okay?
Mr Wenger,... ...do you have some ginger?
Then it will be really tasty.
- It is really cool here.
- I told you so.
- Say, what is actually going on with Karo?
- Why?
She was in the editorial office and was somehow stressed out.
Because of The Wave?
Yes, she somehow wanted to have the student data and write a newsletter and so on.
- Crass, no kidding?
- Yes, no joke.
E-mail is sent.
E- mail transmission canceled.
No lan connection.
Shit!
So, first we thought of Paris,...and then Balaton.
Balaton?
But Italy, good food, beautiful women.
Always need more.
So I thought, why don't you come along as a chaperone.
Let's see, Tim.
Toscana, well, that will be great.
You, Rainer has not to decide that way, Tim.
Yes, but I am sure that all students are for it.
And if not, then we will make a petition.
This was really a nice evening, Tim.
Really.
But Anke and I, we would like to be alone a little bit, we have some things to discuss.
Sure.
Thanks Tim.
See you tomorrow.
Do you know the story of the "Six Wanderers"?
No.
My father told me.
That here, where the great lakes meet... there are still half a dozen floating corpses that haven't been recovered.
Again and again they are seen by divers and mistaken for freshly crashed... until you realize that they are wearing clothes from the eighties.
Most of them are suicides.
But the most blatant is...that they are washed by the current again and again to the same place where they went into the water.
Whether they would somehow ask for salvation or look after the right.
That's why the fishermen call them "The Six Walkers".
Got it.
- Hey, can I?
- Yes.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
It's nice here, isn't it?
I don't want to leave.
Who says you have to leave?
No, it's like this.
After graduating from high school, I want to study somewhere.
I don't even know what.
I could really imagine... doing a normal job,...
...marrying the right woman, having two..,
have three kids... and live out the rest of my days in a townhouse.
- You think it's stupid?
- No, not at all.
Hey, turn off the music and come over here!
Where is Marco?
Marco!
Yes, come here!
Marco!
What is it?
So! So, first of all, really cool that you all came.
Really cool!
And secondly, as you know, we have a game tomorrow against these...these "Vollspacken" from the Ernst-Barlach Gesamtschule.
You all have to come!
It would be really cool if you all come and support us tomorrow!
So, tomorrow at 3 pm in the swimming pool!
You are really cool!
You have to bring everyone you know,
preferably with white shirts!
Everyone!
The enemy should feel the power of The Wave!
Wave!
(Friday) What does this sign mean?
Good morning, Mr Wenger.
Say, what's actually wrong with you?
You can't stay out all night.
Do you actually know what consequences this will have for me?
Shit!
That is an anarchist jerk.
Believe me now, you need protection?
- Hey, you bum, is it still going on?
- Yeah, all right.
...we got them all.
Good.
We can all guess who's responsible for this mess.
We have no proof.
Marco, please.
Marco,...you also want The Wave to continue, right?
Yes, I will talk to her...but after the game, okay?
What do we do with all the pieces of paper?
Destroy them.
Are you still there?
I don't know who did it!
I don't even want to know how you got up there...but one thing is clear, that was life-threatening!
I used to mess up too, you can believe me.
But with something like that the fun stops for me!
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Mr Wenger.
Sit down!
I want you all to write down your experience that you have made with The Wave.
And at the end of the lesson, put them here on my table!
Come on, start!
Time is up.
See you soon, Mr Wenger.
By the way, this doesn't mean that I wouldn't be happy to see one or two of you at the game today.
We need your support.
Mr Wenger, I know who made the graffiti on the Town Hall.
Tim, did I ask you to tell me who is responsible?
I don't want to know who did it...because if I knew, I would have to go to the school administration and inform the police.
Because that happens to be property damage.
I hope this week has shown you that it is better to stick together and not work against each other.
You should take this into consideration and not always be a lone fighter.
I would be happy if you come to the game today.
Okay?
Okay.
Come on!
Yes, now play forward!
Marco, go to the front!
What are you doing?
Yes!
Great!
I can't let you in like this.
What, why?
Get yourselves a Wave shirt, there are still some outside.
But I don't want to wear your shitty Wave shirt!
Everybody is wearing it, now don't make such a fuss.
You are crazy, really.
Right side is blocked by us.
You guys are out of your minds.
Defense, get closer!
Come on, forward now!
To the front!
Yes! Very good, very good.
- And what do you say now?
- Shut up, dude!
No mistakes now!
What do we do now?
I won't be dissuaded that easily.
Now hold back, you're in the lead!
Hup, hup! Faster!
Go, faster!
Fuck off, man!
You bastard!
Okay?
Stop The Wave!
Stop The Wave!
It was so clear!
Come on, collect all the leaves!
Everybody come to me!
Why?
What happened?
Are you stupid or what?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Sinan, what's gotten into you?
Believe me, I... I can't believe it.
And you started the trouble in the first place!
I didn't tell them to punch their opponents in the face!
No, of course not, you didn't do that, of course.
What are you trying to tell me?
You enjoy how they adore you in your classes, hanging on your every word!
What do you want to tell me?
That you wouldn't like it if they hung on your lips because you're a teacher, what are you fooling yourself with?
That's not the point at all!
The students see a role model in you and you manipulate them for your purposes!
There is only your ego thing, do you realize that at all?
You know what I think, I think you're ****** jealous.
What?
Yes, jealous, because they don't see you as a role model despite your A-grade diploma.
Yes, now the narrow-gauge pedagogue is showing you the ropes.
Oh, narrow-gauge pedagogue, that's the problem.
Yes, that's exactly what you think of me!
Abi (earend) through evening classes. Secondary education, sports and political science, what's that?
I didn't think it would be so deep seated.
You didn't think it would be so deep seated, did you?
At least I don't have to take Balderan every Monday morning because I'm scared shitless of school!
Anke...
Anke, wait.
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Yes, you did.
You said it and you meant it!
You've really turned into such an asshole in the last few days.
Just leave me alone!
Karo, wait a minute!
What was that earlier,...have you gone crazy, or what?
You can't do that!
Who do you think you are, Sophie Scholl, or what?
Ask yourself, what's going on with you? What was it like at the swimming pool today?
It was crowded for the first time.
And the fight?
It was only because of this shit here!
You don't understand anything, do you?
We would have won if you hadn't messed everything up.
That pissed you off, didn't it?
It would have been my show for the first time.
Idiot.
- Karo!
- Leave me!
...stop!
Don't touch me.
- Don't touch me!
- .
Get lost!
Marco, what are you doing here?
I messed up.
Come in.
What's wrong?
I've... 
I hit Karo.
You what?
I hit Karo.
Why did you hit Karo?
I don't know.
We had a fight about...
All that shit, it's totally changed me!
I love Karo!
And I hit her anyway.
This pseudo-discipline, it's all fascist shit!
You have to break it off.
Rainer.
I'll think of something.
You have to stop it.
- Immediately!
- Don't tell me what to do.
Yes, I...
I know, Mrs. Kohlhage.
I know, I know exactly, yes.
I don't want to make light of what happened.
No, I take full responsibility.
But I have to talk to my students again.
The only thing I ask of them is a little faith.
Hey guys, just got here.
Tomorrow 12 o'clock school auditorium.
It is about the future of The Wave.
Send it only to members and sympathizers.
Three exclamation marks?
(Saturday) Mr Wenger, it's quarter past twelve.
Then lock the doors, I don't want to be disturbed.
Alright.
Is it okay for you if I stand in front during your speech?
Then I have a better view of the room.
Fine by me.
Are you all right?
Okay, then close the entrance.
Mr Wenger does not want to be disturbed during his speech. Is that clear?
Everybody inside now, we want to start!
Actually I always had everything I wanted, clothes, money, etc.,
but what I had the most, was boredomm 
This is by me.
But the last few days have been really fun.
It is no longer about who is the most beautiful,
the best and the most successful.
The wave has made us all equal.
Origin, religion and social environment no longer play a role.
We all belong to a movement.
The wave gives us a meaning again.
Ideals that are worth standing up for.
I used to beat up on others.
When I honestly think about it, that was really "crummy".
It is much better to stand up for a good cause.
If everyone can rely on the other, we achieve so much more.
For that I am ready to take myself back.
As I'm sure you've all noticed,...these are all excerpts from your essays about last week's experience.
I am very impressed with what The Wave has brought you.
And therefore I am also of the opinion that this project must not end just like that.
- Rainer, what is this shit?
- Marco, sit down.
Yes, but... Man, people think...
I told you to sit down!
For years Germany is going downhill!
We are the losers of the globalization...but the politics wants to make us believe,
that more and more performance...is the only way out of the crisis.
But politicians are only puppets of the economy!
The unemployment rate is to sink!
We are also still export world champion!
But in reality it is nevertheless in such a way,...the poor become ever poorer and the rich ever richer!
The only big threat is the terror.
A terror that we ourselves have created by the injustice in the world that we allow!
And while we slowly but surely ruin our planet ...
... sit there some super-rich and rub their hands.
Build space capsules and look at the whole thing even from above!
Do not you understand then what he has in mind?
He wants to manipulate you all!
Now is good, sit down.
You will not stop me
...from telling the truth, Marco.
The Wave is the real problem!
No, The Wave is the only way to counter this development!
Because together we can do everything!
We!
We have the opportunity here today,
...to write history!
Your girlfriend has turned you against us.
That's your problem.
- That's not true.
- Of course it's true!
She's completely infected you with her shit.
You will not stop us!
From here, The Wave will overrun the whole Germany!
And whoever stands in our way... ...will be flattened by The Wave!
That's right.
Bring the traitor to the front!
Marco, I ask you now here in front of everyone:
Are you for us or against us?
Have you completely lost your mind, or what?
What are we going to do with the traitor?
What should we do with the traitor?
Bomber, you tell me!
Go on, say!
You brought him up here.
Yeah, sure, because you said so.
Yeah, because I said so, huh?
And would you kill him.., if I told you?
We could hang him or decapitate him!
Or maybe we'll torture him...so that he'll confess to our rules!
That's what you do in a dictatorship.
Do you realize what just happened here?
- Everything okay, Marco?
Yes, everything is fine.
Do you still remember... what kind of question was in the room last week?
If something like dictatorship is still possible in our country.
This was exactly that, fascism.
We all thought we were better.
Better than all the others.
And what is even worse...we excluded all those who did not agree with us from our community.
We hurt them.
And I don't want to know what else we were capable of.
I have to apologize to you.
We have gone too far.
I have gone too far.
This is the end of the line.
And what does it mean now... ...for The Wave?
That it is over.
Just like that?
Yes, just like that.
No, it is not over.
Yes, Tim, it is over.
But not everything about The Wave is bad!
We have all felt it.
Yes, we made mistakes, but we can correct them!
No, Dennis, ...you can't correct such things.
I want you all to go home now.
There's certainly enough for you to think about.
- Maja, I...
- Let me.
Stop!
Everybody stay seated and close the doors!
Nobody goes home!
- Put the gun down.
- They lied to us.
The Wave is alive, it's not dead!
Say it: "The Wave is alive"!
That's just a gas gun.
Yes...
Now you take me seriously!
Do you think I don't know that you always messed with me...
How you have screwed me up.
The Wave,...that was my life.
Tim, calm down.
Take it easy.
Put the gun down.
One more step and I shoot them in the face.
And then?
What will happen then?
Then there is no Mr Wenger anymore,
...who can lead your Wave.
Is that what you want?
