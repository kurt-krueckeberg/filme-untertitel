An A-ni-ma... What kind of weird writing is that?
These are the people who paid for the movie. They're all being named now.
One by one.
- And who are you? - Tiffany, and you?
The evil aunt, hahahaha!
You don't look evil.
I'm just playing the evil aunt. I'm, well, an actress.
Hmm, nice dress you're wearing.
It's from the costume shop. I picked it out myself. Real ruffles!
- Get ready, kids! - The movie's starting.
- On the third bell. - Take your places!
- Okay, okay, I'm coming! - Shoo, shoo, here!
- Tomi is waiting. - Tomi?
Tomi Ungerer, the storyteller.
Shh, here we go!
Once upon a time...
Once upon a time...
three grim robbers.
with wide black coats...
and black hats.
At night, when it was dark...
they lay in wait by the wayside.
The first one had a...
blunderbuss!
The second had a bellows...with pepper.
The third had...a huge red hatchet.
When they appeared, the women would fall down in fear.
And even the bravest men took flight.
They were terrible guys.
We are the icy dark figures
creeping through the night
Gold and money and precious stone we rob and it laughs....
The pale moon in the misty light, when our rifle cracks
Now pay attention, hand over everything, otherwise we'll hit you on the roof.
Robbing is a child's game, no one plays it like us
The rifle bangs, the bellows blow pepper against the animals.
Then the carriage stands dead still, welcome to the last part.
The spokes of the carriage wheel crack under our axe
Babum babum surrender at once, otherwise it's over
We sharpen the knives, then they better cut out your little heart
Babum babum surrender now, otherwise it's over
We'll sharpen the knives, then they'll cut better
your throat in two.
I'll puke on Hotzenplotz, that's a little mouse fart.
Here in the forest we are law and your trial will surely be short
We laugh at gendarmes, spare the poor, the king's army is scared
We'll get the bulging bag from the fat nobleman's belly.
Baboom baboom, we'll surrender in a moment, take everything you want from us.
But spare our lives, we won't give them, please, take our gold.
Baboom, baboom, we'll surrender right away, take anything you want from us.
Please!
Hmm, yes. You can have a lot of fun in life when there's three of you.
But there are other people who are alone.
You know what I mean? All alone.
Dear Mom and Dad...
the carriage is coming to take me away.
I didn't want to say goodbye to you.
I miss you so much.
Every evening and every morning and all day long.
I wish we were home together again.
I love you very much.
You'll still take care of me, even if you're in heaven. Won't you?
And I'll take care of you, Pimpernella.
Say goodbye, Tiffany.
The carriage is waiting.
Yes, yes, all right.
- Has the girl got the papers? - Of course! Stamp, signature.
The girl belongs to the orphanage now.
Orphanage? I don't want to go to the orphanage!
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want!
Help! Help!
Help! Police!
No! I want my mom and dad!
Help!
Oh, my God!
Well, that's sounds. 
So, Tiffany. Children who don't have parents...
have to go to an orphanage.
I don't want to go to an orphanage. Neither does Pimpanella.
That's enough!
Let me out of here!
Hello! I don't want to go to the orphanage. Hello!
Hello! Can you hear me?
Help, let me out!
Goodbye, little Tiffany. Goodbye.
Open up! Open up! Let me out of here!
Let me out, I said!
Help, police! I want to see the gendarme...
and I want my mommy and daddy! I want to get out of here! I want to get out of here!
Yes, it's not easy to be a gendarme...
And the damn robbers have been running around for 30 years now.
Oh, boy.
Brave girl. There she goes, to the orphanage.
Quitting time.
Wow!
Tight.
No one can get in here, Miss Pimpernella.
We're perfectly safe in here.
But if you're afraid, dear Pimpernella, feel free to sit next to me.
Of course, I can also put an arm around you, if that makes you feel better.
Yes, please, that's better, isn't it?
It was just an owl, silly.
Miss Pimpernella, what are you doing down there?
You'll get your beautiful dress very, very dirty.
Pimpanella, you can't do that!
There, that's good.
Don't be afraid, I'll take care of you!
Meanwhile, deep in the forest...
three dark fellows
are on their way to work.
So, sit down here comfortably...
and... then I'll read to you from my storybook.
Now...
Once upon a time there was a Ma-ha-rad-rad-scha
Maharajah, phew.
ma-ha-ra-dscha...
and he lived in a golden castle. Like this.
So there, he lived in this, uh, castle, right?
And this... this was in India and it was all gold.
Yes, that's exactly how it was.
He was incredibly rich, this maharajah.
And he lived there, in this faraway India...
in this castle made of pure gold.
But the greatest thing, you won't believe me...
was the treasury.
It was really the greatest thing!
It was crammed full of pearls...
and with samragden and "diamunen"
and with gold and with silver and gold and rings and chains and crowns.
Yes, and capes and bracelets and everything made of gold.
But his greatest treasure lived in the children's room.
That was his daughter.
She was very, very beautiful...
and so brave, the world has never seen.
The maharajah loved his daughter so much...
...that he made her every wish come true.
One day, the good maharajah...
...gave his beautiful daughter an orphanage.
It was now really by far
the most beautiful orphanage in the whole of India.
The jubilation was great, of course.
There was no happier...
Indian princess.
But suddenly...
What is it?
Yes, what is it, Grigou?
Nothing. Just a little girl.
A little girl?
Good evening!
Oh, Menno!
Somebody take care of the coachman.
- Look. Oh, a suitcase!
Hey, that's mine, you thieves!
Nothing!
Nothing either!
Oh no!
- Nothing at all. - Nothing.
No gold.
What the hell!
Marschi ma kullo!
Save your blunderbuss, Thunderjakob!
Alright, Grigou.
Flinn, come on! There's nothing to get here. Let's go!
Marschi ma kullo! What a day this is!
One bandit is dumber than the other...
and in the only carriage there's nothing but a screeching dribbler.
What have I done to deserve this?
Hey, thieves, stop!
You can't just leave me here alone!
We are not thieves, we are robbers!
Robbers!
Stop, I said! Take me with you.
After all, I'm your prey!
If you don't want to, there'll be no gold!
Well, Miss Pimpanella...
The robbers...
seem to have enough gold already!
Gold?
Gold?
Did you say gold?
There was no gold. Just the weasel there.
Children don't have gold yet.
But my dad...
He's a rich maharajah.
He has as much gold as, as, as, as...
You're lying!
You can take me with you and exchange me for my dad's gold.
Then you'll see it, the ransom gold.
What do you think? These are lean times.
Yes, lean times they are!
No robbers doing that!
Watch this, kid!
You're our prisoner now!
There's no escape!
Resistance is futile!
Yes!
Let's go!
Quitting time, brothers.
Throw the little weasel into a corner!
But she's sleeping so peacefully!
Shouldn't we put her...
In our bed?
Never! Over my dead body! Over my dead body!
This is the first night.
There's... real trouble.
There's real, real trouble.
I'm cold.
My children!
You sweet orphans!
I love you so much!
I'm in a lot of trouble.
Gregory! Wake up!
Auntie is in great distress again and we are late again!
Hurry up!
Did you hear?
We're breaking her heart and we've disappointed her beyond belief.
Wake up!
Uah! How can you torture your best friend...
...at such a time?
What's the golden rule?
You!
No beet, no love!
I don't understand you!
No beet, no love!
That's right!
Repeat it, all of you!
No beet, no love!
A simple thing, isn't it?
One would like to think so.
How many sugar beets do you see here?
Is that all I mean to you?
Not a bit more? Hmm?
How can I love you...
you dear little children?!
Morning!
Oh.
Did you gentlemen manage to get up?
I hope you had a nice rest.
Where is he coming from at this hour?
And where is the girl?
Robbers, madam. Dozens of them!
The girl was kidnapped.
I fought like a lion, but there were too many!
That's right, there were too many of them!
But I saved the carriage.
He let the girl be taken away.
Oh, what a pity!
Does he know what will happen to him if he lets me down so bitterly?
He has lost her.
He didn't bring her!
There! There! There!
It must hurt! Hurt! Hurt! Hurt!
Slave!
Good-for-nothing!
Get me a new whip!
All orphans show me today...
how much you really love me!
Many, many little turnips I want to see!
No turnip, no love!
Off!
You two stay here!
So, my two special friends...
Now to you!
Engine duty!
Oh, no, no machine duty!
I'd like to know what this machine is for.
Oh, they're still asleep!
Stupid lilac mice, I'm not afraid!
Good morning, spider!
Oh, look, Pimpernella.
How beautiful the world is!
Look, a telescope!
It's horrible!
There's no such thing!
Poor children!
Uah, that must be the orphanage.
Good thing we didn't end up there!
- Hello? Now you listen to me, gendarme. You don't seem...
you don't seem to understand the gravity of the situation.
Do you have any idea what I'd be going through..,
if I don't have the poor child under my wing?
Here in my cozy little orphanage!
I assure you, madam...
Papperlapapp! Talk! Always talk, talk, talk!
If that cursed orphan isn't in my fields by morning..,
you'll never be happy as a gendarme in your miserable policeman's life!
If you think...
Now, get that girl in here! And hurry up!
Yes, sir!
I'm going to print the wanted posters for Tiffany.
Oh, so early in the morning and already so much work...
Mmmm, that coffee smells really yummy! You did a great job, Pimpernella!
Good morning!
Beautiful!
And how it smells!
How do we get your gold, little girl?
It's easy, really.
A letter! We need a kidnapper's letter!
Well, so that my daddy knows
that you've kidnapped me.
- A letter? - From us?
Yes, to send the ransom gold to you.
And when you get the gold, you'll let me go.
Sounds good to me. It does! Very clever.
The only trouble is...
What's the trouble?
That my dad is so far away.
Unfortunately very far away.
So sending him may take a while.
How long?
Well, like... one or two...
Minutes?
Hours?
Days?
Weeks.
That long?
Where is he, your papa?
In... in... in... India.
- In-in-in-in-in... - Where's that? In-in-in...
India, you raccoon!
Look at that! In-in-in-in-India!
Can't you think in peace for once?
What do you think, Grigou?
I'm thinking
how to get our gold!
With a letter. I told you so.
- That's right, with a letter! - Quiet!
Damn it!
The trouble is...
What's the problem?
- He can't write yet. - Neither can you.
But I can write!
Two weeks, Grigou!
The little one doesn't bother anyone!
And she can make coffee!
That was Miss Pimpanella!
That's cute, Grigou!
Guys, ink and paper, please!
Clogged up again!
Machine service is a pain in the ass!
The mud from the beets stinks! Eh!
Gregory, look at this, you won't believe it!
This is madness!
What the hell is that?
I don't know what it is. But it's coming out of the beets somehow, and it's...
Mmm, mmm, it's delicious!
It must be syrup. The sugar from the beets!
Why don't we get something like that, we always get gross mush?
Yes, yes, because sugar is forbidden for children...
and because sugar is unhealthy.
And bad for the teeth. For the stomach, too.
There will be a thunderstorm!
Write: "Dear Mr. Maharajah..."
Mm-mm. "Dear" doesn't work.
This is not a normal letter, it's a blackmailer's letter.
I'm a robber, not a blackmailer!
Then write: "Dear Mr. Maharajah..."
No, too polite.
I'll just write: "Maharajah."
You can draw great letters!
Write: "Maharajah..."
"We've kidnapped your daughter..."
No, no, no...
"We have...kidnapped your daughter..."
Um... "kidnapped..."
Ah, of course. "We kidnapped your daughter."
No, kidnapped...stolen....
Write "kidnapped", et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
"And no police!"
Got it?
How did it go on?
"Maharajah..."
"Maharajah..."
"Maharajah, we've kidnapped your daughter."
No, no, "we have kidnapped your daughter."
"...Kidnapped."
Of course, it would be, "We have kidnapped your daughter."
No, kidnapped!
Kidnapped. No, write kidnapped!
"And no police!"
Understand? - "Po-li-zei."
Done!
I don't feel like it anymore. I'm leaving.
- What? - We're leaving. You're coming with us.
But Auntie said we can't run away.
If we do, we'll be like those three brothers who ran away.
They were eaten by wolves.
And when the moon is full, you can still hear them screaming.
Are you really so stupid as to believe that?
Come on, Nikolas. Here, the sheets. Quick!
Ouch, it's your foot! Watch out!
An escape attempt.
How cute!
They're way too weak for the outside world.
They're coming back.
Quick!
Tell me, Tiffany, where do you learn that?
My mommy taught me!
I wish I could do that too. Write.
I can show you.
Me? With fingers like these?
Yeah, sure!
Wouldn't be bad to be able to write, of course.
- And I could write my "mamuars" then. - Donnerjakob!
- Huh? - "Memoirs. "
Donnerjakob: My life as a robber.
Halt!
That's the forest mailbox.
And now off, the mail.
Will anyone find it?
Of course! Everybody comes here! Everybody!
My magnificent...
beet sugar machine!
What am I in the mood for?
A buttercream cake?
No. Peppermint candy?
No, no...a candy cane.
Candy cane, a candy cane....
And for dessert...
A jam layer cake.
Mmmmm, dessert!
So, the letter is gone!
Then we'll finally have our gold in two weeks.
And then I'll be free and can finally go.
Heißa-juchei.
That's right. Isn't that swell?
And you'll be back home...
...with your daddy in In-in-in-India.
Yeah, that'd be nice, home...
in our golden palace.
With my three brothers.
- What? - You have brothers?
- Three of them? - Yes, I have three brothers.
And what brothers!
One of them always plays hide and seek with me as long as I want!
When I'm tired, the other one shows me...
some new elephant tricks.
Sit!
And the third one,
he even has a flying carpet!
And we fly until we...
Enough with the... with the banter! We have to go to work!
Oh, yes, work...
Come on, brothers.
And we'll bring you a little something.
Ah, what a beautiful night!
Thunderjakob!
Good luck and a fat booty!
- Tiffany... - Yes?
Make yourself comfortable!
Yeah, make yourself at home. Make yourself at home.
Flying carpet, pah!
I'm hungry!
Hear that? What's that?
Shut up, I don't hear anything.
Maybe it was just fireflies.
Look out! Look out!
Put your foot there...
Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!
That was close.
Teddy bear, teddy bear, you're out!
Teddy bear, teddy bear, run home!
Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around.
Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around
Teddy bear, teddy bear, how old are you?
One hundred and five!
One, two, three...
four, five...
six...
I'm a little Indian princess.
Look at that!
A real little robberess.
You've got a lot of gold!
What are you doing with it?
Uh... rob.
Why? Why?
And then what?
If you robbed it, what do you do with it?
Do what?
I don't know.
It's just lying here.
In our treasury.
- This is where we put it. -Mm-hmm.
And we brought something for you too, princess.
A little something.
But don't break it!
Oh, you darlings!
I don't know how to play the piano.
Here we go, brothers!
- To the instruments! - Oh, yes!
I want too! I want an instrument too! Flinn, please, please!
Here, take this.
You're only on it three times!
Now?
Now, now.
Now.
Well, it's much nicer out here in the dark forest...
than in the orphanage.
Huh, Nikolas?
And tomorrow we'll gather wood in time,
so we can have a campfire at night.
Oh, yeah.
Ouch!
- Good night, Nikolas. - Good night, Gregory.
Sleep...
Sleep, my sweet little children.
Tomorrow we'll go back to the beets!
You must be rested!
Sweet dreams...
No turnip, no love.
Sleep...
Sleep...
soundly.
This is the second night.
So, Mr. Woodpecker, that's it.
I've warned you often enough.
Now I'm writing you up for disturbing the peace.
Charges against Woodpecker...
Name?
Good morning, dear robbers!
- Good morning, princess. - Good morning, Tiffany.
Today we'll learn to read and write.
- Oh, yes! - Great!
Begin!
And so the ABC's go...
Unbelievable!
Brilliant!
- Oh, that's... - Oh!
Hey, I can write! Check it out!
Hey, I can read!
Wow!
"We hold these truths to be self-evident..."
"that all men are created equal."
"...And that they have received from their Creator certain..."
Hmph, pig claw. "...inalienable rights..."
"...among which are life, liberty, and..."
"...the pursuit of happiness."
Guys, that's a straight A!
I'm not writing it down. They don't exist.
They're just a figment of my wild imagination.
I'm hungry.
Look! Berries! - Wow!
Mmm, yummy!
Yuck! Turnip grease...
Gross!
An egg whipped sugar
Caramel strawberry cream pie!
Yummy yummy yummy!
Well, ladies and gentlemen, what you're doing is clearly...
...public nuisance and....
Hello!
I'm warning you...
Oh, boy!
Look, isn't that the gendarme?
He sees nothing and hears nothing.
We can rob in peace.
He's probably writing down a few checks right now.
For speeding!
What a jerk!
Hello, Tiffany!
What?
Marchy ma kullo!
I always knew it!
That looks like Tiffany!
We can read now.
Yeah, read it!
"Ti-ffa-ny... "
Tiffany!
A wanted poster.
Maybe she has...maybe Tiffany has a twin sister?
Of course, and her name is also Tiffany!
Well, it's possible.
"Wanted."
She is wanted. Tiffany is wanted, like us.
Yes, wanted. "The orphan Tiffany."
- Orphan? - An orphan?
So she doesn't have any parents.
But then there would be no majarajah.
No elephants, no brothers...
And no penny ransom gold!
Good evening, dear robbers.
Have you robbed anything today?
What does it say?
It says, "Wanted."
"The orphan... Tiffany. "
What's that?
"Wanted... The orphan... Tiffany... "
You think...
You can nest here like a maggot in bacon,
eat the hair off our heads and make a mess of everything?
I wanted to be a robber too.
You think we're stupid, don't you?
We're just the stupid robbers.
We won't let ourselves be pushed around by an orphan.
Grigou...
It's true.
I'm an orphan.
No gold, worth nothing. And now...
I'm going to an orphanage.
I guess that's where orphans belong.
Tiffany, you can't...
Goodbye, Thunderjakob.
Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.
Grigou, for God's sake,
The child is going!
To the orphanage.
Grigou, Tiffany is going to the orphanage!
Wonderful... such peace!
Great, the silence. Nice and quiet.
- Thunderjakob... - What?
Oh, I see...
Hey, Grigou, little Tiffany is alone in the forest...
She doesn't have her doll with her.
Should she just go... there, there... to the orphanage?
Leave me alone! It's the middle of the night!
And what do I care about that lying weasel?
That's right. You're... you're right, Grigou.
What do you care about those kids? They're just orphans!
Grigou... "No beetroots, no love!"
For God's sake!
Marchy ma kullo!
Fireflies, Nikolas. They're all just fireflies.
We're surrounded by itty bitty cute fireflies.
Good evening...
A girl!
Just an ordinary little girl.
I think you're an orphan.
I am an orphan. How do you know?
Because the night before last...
a little girl was stolen from the carriage.
We're orphans too. We ran away.
- My name is Gregory. - And I'm Nikolas.
And you?
Tiffany.
This is the third night.
We were orphans.
Because now we are free and we want to see the big world.
The world is waiting for us!
Nobody waits for me.
And I don't want the world either, I already know it.
It'll stop. After a while it doesn't hurt anymore.
Here. I give you.
I don't believe it! Did you steal from someone?
I already stole. I'm not stealing.
I think I'm crazy!
We're rich! We can live on it!
We'll buy a house! No, better yet, a boat!
And then we'll drive around all the time!
Or a carriage with a sleeping cabin.
Nonsense: a carriage and a boat.
Gold, gold, gold... I don't give a damn about gold!
The robbers only took me because they wanted more and more gold!
Robbers?
They don't give a damn that I'm an orphan.
What do they know about being all alone?
Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going to the orphanage. - Tiffany, you're crazy!
Children who don't have parents anymore, they have to go to an orphanage.
That's how it is.
Hey, wait a minute!
- The three of us have to stay together! - You can't leave us like this!
Are you going to let that horrible aunt order you around voluntarily?
There, look closely. Do you really want to go there?
At least there are other orphans like us.
If it weren't for that witch, it wouldn't be so bad with the other kids.
How many children live there?
About twenty. Or eighty.
Bullshit!
Three hundred at least! Or seven hundred and sixty-five!
- And only one aunt? - One.
Only one aunt...
But she's dangerous as hell.
She lives at the top of the tower.
God knows what she's doing up there.
Let's go!
Yes, I see her!
She's really going to the orphanage!
There are two others too.
We have to go there, Grigou!
I... I can't, brothers.
...to the orphanage.
To the evil aunt.
I don't dare.
I'm... I'm scared.
Together we can do it. It's about Tiffany.
What, thunderjacks?
Flinn is right, brother. Let's go!
Let's go!
Shh, quiet! So no one hears us.
The kids are all asleep.
The children are all asleep. They're dead tired from working in the beet field.
Auntie is always awake.
She sits in her tower room at night...
and you hear strange noises.
Like: "Knark-knark-knark" and stuff like that.
- You have to watch out for the coachman. - Why?
He's always lying in corners.
- Then he strikes. - You don't suspect anything bad.
To the aunt's room! Follow me!
We... better stay outside.
- We'll keep a lookout. - Shit bunnies!
- See you in a minute. - See you in a minute.
Here's a... chocolate.
And another chocolate!
What's this?
Look at that.
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
Welcome, dear viewers...
to the screening of..:
"The World's Dumbest Orphans!"
My dear Nikolas.
Dearest Gregory.
So you would like to apply?
Very well.
And you're really dumb enough?
Let's see then. It'll be fun!
I'll sing and you dance.
Let's go!
In the forest, there are robbers...
Hello... Hello...
Who was that?!
There are more up here! The whole room is full of cakes!
They're piled up to the ceiling!
How dare you?
Quick, Tiffany, you have to run!
Get out!
Put me down, you monster!
Let me go! Aaah!
What a naughty little thing!
Get her!
The three robbers... in my castle!
Help!
You have no business here, I rule!
Get out of my orphanage!
Or I'll call the police!
Yeah, that's what I like: racing in the woods!
I'm going to fine you for speeding...
They're gone.
I don't believe it!
That sly little Grigou...
and his two brothers!
That stupid Thunderjakob, and...
and that idiot Flinn!
Well, you runaways, you've grown up so much.
Well, after thirty years.
We brought your doll, Tiffany.
Pimpanella. You forgot it, Tiffany.
Besides, we were wondering if you...
...if you could...
I beg your pardon?
...if you were coming back to us.
We... uh... miss you.
Life is so colorful
when you're around.
And your...
And your laugh, you know, it tickles so nicely...
in the robber's ears. Yes.
Ah, Grigou!
Well, well, well!
I'm sure I have something to say about that.
The orphan paragraph reads:
Parentless children...
belong in an orphanage.
Patsch.
I get it!
There's no room for evil in this movie!
Then I can go! Huh? Huh? Huh?
I'm going!
Ungrateful vermin!
You'll never see me again!
That's what you get!
And finally, I'd like to wish for a cannonball...
Ah, nonsense! ...ice cream bomb!
Yummy-yummy-yummy-yummy.
That tickles!
I feel dizzy...
Dizzy, dizzy!
Farewell, you ungrateful brats!
What's going on?
Robber hats? Robber hats!
Where there are bandits' hats, there are bandits.
Attention! Listen up!
Robbers, step forward!
There are no robbers here, Mr. Gendarme. Only orphans.
And where is the head of the orphanage?
- Uh... away. - That's right, she's gone!
She's disappeared.
We can't get her back.
It's a discontinued model.
It's gone.
This house is ours now!
That's not correct...
This house is municipal property.
I'm in charge now.
We'll buy the house.
Nikolas, the daler.
That's very kind of you, children.
But I'm afraid it's not enough.
And then the robbers took a little bit of gold...
And they bought the house for the children
The story got around very quickly
And that's why it's over.
Many a day a child lay at the orphanage gate
And they helped him in his need
And the crowd of children grew and wore coats and hats
Like the robbers, the three of them, only in red
And there was a laugh that went through the air
And filled the whole house
From the windows in the house children looked out,
Happy children looked out.
And a child first grows up and then really old
And a girl becomes a woman, a boy a man.
And the men and women soon marry
And make new children
Then they built themselves houses nearby.
Soon it was a whole little town with....
 People all wearing red hats...
And red coats.
Finally, they built a city wall...
with three mighty towers,
one for each robber...
out of gratitude.
We are the icy dark figures
creeping through the night
Gold and money and precious stones we rob and it laughs
the pale moon in the misty light, when our rifle cracks.
So pay attention, hand over everything, or we'll hit you on the roof.
Robbing is child's play, no one plays it like us
The rifle bangs the bellows blows pepper against the animals
Then the carriage stands dead still, welcome to the last part
The spokes of the carriage wheel crackle under our axe
Will anyone find him?
Of course! Everybody passes by here! Everybody!
Robbery is a child's game, no one plays it like we do
The rifle bangs, the bellows blow pepper against the animals
Then the carriage stands dead still, welcome to the last part
The spokes of the carriage wheel crack under our axe
Baboom, baboom, surrender at once, otherwise it's over
We'll sharpen the knives then they better cut out your little heart
Baboom, baboom, surrender now, or else it's over
We'll sharpen the knives, then they'd better separate
Your throat in two
We are at home in our robber's nest, hidden deep in the forest.
The gold is gone, we don't care, we'll get more soon.
Hold it right there! Hands up, this is a robbery
We'll take everything that glitters.
We steal from young and old
Baboom, baboom, surrender now, otherwise it's over.
We sharpen the knives, then they better cut out your little heart
Baboom, baboom, surrender now, or else it's over
We'll sharpen the knives, they'd better part
Your throat in two
I'll puke on Hotzenplotz, that's a little mouse fart.
Here in the forest we are the law and your trial will be short.
We laugh at the gendarmes, we spare the poor, the king's army is afraid.
We'll get the bulging bag from the fat nobleman's belly.
Baboom, baboom, we'll surrender in a moment, take everything you want from us.
But spare our lives, we won't give them, here you go, take our gold.
Marchi ma kullo!
And what does "marschi ma kullo" mean?
It means...well, it's a swear word....
It means...
- So... - Kiss my a-!
That's right, that's what it means.
Marschi ma kullo!
