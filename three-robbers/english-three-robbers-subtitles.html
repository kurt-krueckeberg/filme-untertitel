<div id="grid-col"><p>An A-ni-ma... What kind of weird writing is that?</p>
<p>These are the people who paid for the movie. They're all being named now.</p>
<p>One by one.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And who are you? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tiffany, and you?</p>
<p>The evil aunt, hahahaha!</p>
<p>You don't look evil.</p>
<p>I'm just playing the evil aunt. I'm, well, an actress.</p>
<p>Hmm, nice dress you're wearing.</p>
<p>It's from the costume shop. I picked it out myself. Real ruffles!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Get ready, kids! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>The movie's starting.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>On the third bell. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Take your places!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Okay, okay, I'm coming! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Shoo, shoo, here!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tomi is waiting. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tomi?</p>
<p>Tomi Ungerer, the storyteller.</p>
<p>Shh, here we go!</p>
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>three grim robbers.</p>
<p>with wide black coats...</p>
<p>and black hats.</p>
<p>At night, when it was dark...</p>
<p>they lay in wait by the wayside.</p>
<p>The first one had a...</p>
<p>blunderbuss!</p>
<p>The second had a bellows...with pepper.</p>
<p>The third had...a huge red hatchet.</p>
<p>When they appeared, the women would fall down in fear.</p>
<p>And even the bravest men took flight.</p>
<p>They were terrible guys.</p>
<p>We are the icy dark figures</p>
<p>creeping through the night</p>
<p>Gold and money and precious stone we rob and it laughs....</p>
<p>The pale moon in the misty light, when our rifle cracks</p>
<p>Now pay attention, hand over everything, otherwise we'll hit you on the roof.</p>
<p>Robbing is a child's game, no one plays it like us</p>
<p>The rifle bangs, the bellows blow pepper against the animals.</p>
<p>Then the carriage stands dead still, welcome to the last part.</p>
<p>The spokes of the carriage wheel crack under our axe</p>
<p>Babum babum surrender at once, otherwise it's over</p>
<p>We sharpen the knives, then they better cut out your little heart</p>
<p>Babum babum surrender now, otherwise it's over</p>
<p>We'll sharpen the knives, then they'll cut better</p>
<p>your throat in two.</p>
<p>I'll puke on Hotzenplotz, that's a little mouse fart.</p>
<p>Here in the forest we are law and your trial will surely be short</p>
<p>We laugh at gendarmes, spare the poor, the king's army is scared</p>
<p>We'll get the bulging bag from the fat nobleman's belly.</p>
<p>Baboom baboom, we'll surrender in a moment, take everything you want from us.</p>
<p>But spare our lives, we won't give them, please, take our gold.</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, we'll surrender right away, take anything you want from us.</p>
<p>Please!</p>
<p>Hmm, yes. You can have a lot of fun in life when there's three of you.</p>
<p>But there are other people who are alone.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? All alone.</p>
<p>Dear Mom and Dad...</p>
<p>the carriage is coming to take me away.</p>
<p>I didn't want to say goodbye to you.</p>
<p>I miss you so much.</p>
<p>Every evening and every morning and all day long.</p>
<p>I wish we were home together again.</p>
<p>I love you very much.</p>
<p>You'll still take care of me, even if you're in heaven. Won't you?</p>
<p>And I'll take care of you, Pimpernella.</p>
<p>Say goodbye, Tiffany.</p>
<p>The carriage is waiting.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, all right.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Has the girl got the papers? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Of course! Stamp, signature.</p>
<p>The girl belongs to the orphanage now.</p>
<p>Orphanage? I don't want to go to the orphanage!</p>
<p>I don't want, I don't want, I don't want!</p>
<p>Help! Help!</p>
<p>Help! Police!</p>
<p>No! I want my mom and dad!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Well, that's sounds.</p>
<p>So, Tiffany. Children who don't have parents...</p>
<p>have to go to an orphanage.</p>
<p>I don't want to go to an orphanage. Neither does Pimpanella.</p>
<p>That's enough!</p>
<p>Let me out of here!</p>
<p>Hello! I don't want to go to the orphanage. Hello!</p>
<p>Hello! Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Help, let me out!</p>
<p>Goodbye, little Tiffany. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Open up! Open up! Let me out of here!</p>
<p>Let me out, I said!</p>
<p>Help, police! I want to see the gendarme...</p>
<p>and I want my mommy and daddy! I want to get out of here! I want to get out of here!</p>
<p>Yes, it's not easy to be a gendarme...</p>
<p>And the damn robbers have been running around for 30 years now.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Brave girl. There she goes, to the orphanage.</p>
<p>Quitting time.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Tight.</p>
<p>No one can get in here, Miss Pimpernella.</p>
<p>We're perfectly safe in here.</p>
<p>But if you're afraid, dear Pimpernella, feel free to sit next to me.</p>
<p>Of course, I can also put an arm around you, if that makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Yes, please, that's better, isn't it?</p>
<p>It was just an owl, silly.</p>
<p>Miss Pimpernella, what are you doing down there?</p>
<p>You'll get your beautiful dress very, very dirty.</p>
<p>Pimpanella, you can't do that!</p>
<p>There, that's good.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid, I'll take care of you!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deep in the forest...</p>
<p>three dark fellows</p>
<p>are on their way to work.</p>
<p>So, sit down here comfortably...</p>
<p>and... then I'll read to you from my storybook.</p>
<p>Now...</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Ma-ha-rad-rad-scha</p>
<p>Maharajah, phew.</p>
<p>ma-ha-ra-dscha...</p>
<p>and he lived in a golden castle. Like this.</p>
<p>So there, he lived in this, uh, castle, right?</p>
<p>And this... this was in India and it was all gold.</p>
<p>Yes, that's exactly how it was.</p>
<p>He was incredibly rich, this maharajah.</p>
<p>And he lived there, in this faraway India...</p>
<p>in this castle made of pure gold.</p>
<p>But the greatest thing, you won't believe me...</p>
<p>was the treasury.</p>
<p>It was really the greatest thing!</p>
<p>It was crammed full of pearls...</p>
<p>and with samragden and "diamunen"</p>
<p>and with gold and with silver and gold and rings and chains and crowns.</p>
<p>Yes, and capes and bracelets and everything made of gold.</p>
<p>But his greatest treasure lived in the children's room.</p>
<p>That was his daughter.</p>
<p>She was very, very beautiful...</p>
<p>and so brave, the world has never seen.</p>
<p>The maharajah loved his daughter so much...</p>
<p>...that he made her every wish come true.</p>
<p>One day, the good maharajah...</p>
<p>...gave his beautiful daughter an orphanage.</p>
<p>It was now really by far</p>
<p>the most beautiful orphanage in the whole of India.</p>
<p>The jubilation was great, of course.</p>
<p>There was no happier...</p>
<p>Indian princess.</p>
<p>But suddenly...</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Yes, what is it, Grigou?</p>
<p>Nothing. Just a little girl.</p>
<p>A little girl?</p>
<p>Good evening!</p>
<p>Oh, Menno!</p>
<p>Somebody take care of the coachman.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Look. Oh, a suitcase!</p>
<p>Hey, that's mine, you thieves!</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>Nothing either!</p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nothing at all. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nothing.</p>
<p>No gold.</p>
<p>What the hell!</p>
<p>Marschi ma kullo!</p>
<p>Save your blunderbuss, Thunderjakob!</p>
<p>Alright, Grigou.</p>
<p>Flinn, come on! There's nothing to get here. Let's go!</p>
<p>Marschi ma kullo! What a day this is!</p>
<p>One bandit is dumber than the other...</p>
<p>and in the only carriage there's nothing but a screeching dribbler.</p>
<p>What have I done to deserve this?</p>
<p>Hey, thieves, stop!</p>
<p>You can't just leave me here alone!</p>
<p>We are not thieves, we are robbers!</p>
<p>Robbers!</p>
<p>Stop, I said! Take me with you.</p>
<p>After all, I'm your prey!</p>
<p>If you don't want to, there'll be no gold!</p>
<p>Well, Miss Pimpanella...</p>
<p>The robbers...</p>
<p>seem to have enough gold already!</p>
<p>Gold?</p>
<p>Gold?</p>
<p>Did you say gold?</p>
<p>There was no gold. Just the weasel there.</p>
<p>Children don't have gold yet.</p>
<p>But my dad...</p>
<p>He's a rich maharajah.</p>
<p>He has as much gold as, as, as, as...</p>
<p>You're lying!</p>
<p>You can take me with you and exchange me for my dad's gold.</p>
<p>Then you'll see it, the ransom gold.</p>
<p>What do you think? These are lean times.</p>
<p>Yes, lean times they are!</p>
<p>No robbers doing that!</p>
<p>Watch this, kid!</p>
<p>You're our prisoner now!</p>
<p>There's no escape!</p>
<p>Resistance is futile!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Quitting time, brothers.</p>
<p>Throw the little weasel into a corner!</p>
<p>But she's sleeping so peacefully!</p>
<p>Shouldn't we put her...</p>
<p>In our bed?</p>
<p>Never! Over my dead body! Over my dead body!</p>
<p>This is the first night.</p>
<p>There's... real trouble.</p>
<p>There's real, real trouble.</p>
<p>I'm cold.</p>
<p>My children!</p>
<p>You sweet orphans!</p>
<p>I love you so much!</p>
<p>I'm in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Gregory! Wake up!</p>
<p>Auntie is in great distress again and we are late again!</p>
<p>Hurry up!</p>
<p>Did you hear?</p>
<p>We're breaking her heart and we've disappointed her beyond belief.</p>
<p>Wake up!</p>
<p>Uah! How can you torture your best friend...</p>
<p>...at such a time?</p>
<p>What's the golden rule?</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>No beet, no love!</p>
<p>I don't understand you!</p>
<p>No beet, no love!</p>
<p>That's right!</p>
<p>Repeat it, all of you!</p>
<p>No beet, no love!</p>
<p>A simple thing, isn't it?</p>
<p>One would like to think so.</p>
<p>How many sugar beets do you see here?</p>
<p>Is that all I mean to you?</p>
<p>Not a bit more? Hmm?</p>
<p>How can I love you...</p>
<p>you dear little children?!</p>
<p>Morning!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Did you gentlemen manage to get up?</p>
<p>I hope you had a nice rest.</p>
<p>Where is he coming from at this hour?</p>
<p>And where is the girl?</p>
<p>Robbers, madam. Dozens of them!</p>
<p>The girl was kidnapped.</p>
<p>I fought like a lion, but there were too many!</p>
<p>That's right, there were too many of them!</p>
<p>But I saved the carriage.</p>
<p>He let the girl be taken away.</p>
<p>Oh, what a pity!</p>
<p>Does he know what will happen to him if he lets me down so bitterly?</p>
<p>He has lost her.</p>
<p>He didn't bring her!</p>
<p>There! There! There!</p>
<p>It must hurt! Hurt! Hurt! Hurt!</p>
<p>Slave!</p>
<p>Good-for-nothing!</p>
<p>Get me a new whip!</p>
<p>All orphans show me today...</p>
<p>how much you really love me!</p>
<p>Many, many little turnips I want to see!</p>
<p>No turnip, no love!</p>
<p>Off!</p>
<p>You two stay here!</p>
<p>So, my two special friends...</p>
<p>Now to you!</p>
<p>Engine duty!</p>
<p>Oh, no, no machine duty!</p>
<p>I'd like to know what this machine is for.</p>
<p>Oh, they're still asleep!</p>
<p>Stupid lilac mice, I'm not afraid!</p>
<p>Good morning, spider!</p>
<p>Oh, look, Pimpernella.</p>
<p>How beautiful the world is!</p>
<p>Look, a telescope!</p>
<p>It's horrible!</p>
<p>There's no such thing!</p>
<p>Poor children!</p>
<p>Uah, that must be the orphanage.</p>
<p>Good thing we didn't end up there!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hello? Now you listen to me, gendarme. You don't seem...</p>
<p>you don't seem to understand the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what I'd be going through..,</p>
<p>if I don't have the poor child under my wing?</p>
<p>Here in my cozy little orphanage!</p>
<p>I assure you, madam...</p>
<p>Papperlapapp! Talk! Always talk, talk, talk!</p>
<p>If that cursed orphan isn't in my fields by morning..,</p>
<p>you'll never be happy as a gendarme in your miserable policeman's life!</p>
<p>If you think...</p>
<p>Now, get that girl in here! And hurry up!</p>
<p>Yes, sir!</p>
<p>I'm going to print the wanted posters for Tiffany.</p>
<p>Oh, so early in the morning and already so much work...</p>
<p>Mmmm, that coffee smells really yummy! You did a great job, Pimpernella!</p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>Beautiful!</p>
<p>And how it smells!</p>
<p>How do we get your gold, little girl?</p>
<p>It's easy, really.</p>
<p>A letter! We need a kidnapper's letter!</p>
<p>Well, so that my daddy knows</p>
<p>that you've kidnapped me.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>A letter? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>From us?</p>
<p>Yes, to send the ransom gold to you.</p>
<p>And when you get the gold, you'll let me go.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me. It does! Very clever.</p>
<p>The only trouble is...</p>
<p>What's the trouble?</p>
<p>That my dad is so far away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately very far away.</p>
<p>So sending him may take a while.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>Well, like... one or two...</p>
<p>Minutes?</p>
<p>Hours?</p>
<p>Days?</p>
<p>Weeks.</p>
<p>That long?</p>
<p>Where is he, your papa?</p>
<p>In... in... in... in India.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>In...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>n-in-in-in... - Where is that? In-in-in...</p>
<p>India, you raccoon!</p>
<p>Look at that! In-in-in-in-India!</p>
<p>Can't you think in peace for once?</p>
<p>What do you think, Grigou?</p>
<p>I'm thinking</p>
<p>how to get our gold!</p>
<p>With a letter. I told you so.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's right, with a letter! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Quiet!</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>The trouble is...</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He can't write yet. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Neither can you.</p>
<p>But I can write!</p>
<p>Two weeks, Grigou!</p>
<p>The little one doesn't bother anyone!</p>
<p>And she can make coffee!</p>
<p>That was Miss Pimpanella!</p>
<p>That's cute, Grigou!</p>
<p>Guys, ink and paper, please!</p>
<p>Clogged up again!</p>
<p>Machine service is a pain in the ass!</p>
<p>The mud from the beets stinks! Eh!</p>
<p>Gregory, look at this, you won't believe it!</p>
<p>This is madness!</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>I don't know what it is. But it's coming out of the beets somehow, and it's...</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, it's delicious!</p>
<p>It must be syrup. The sugar from the beets!</p>
<p>Why don't we get something like that, we always get gross mush?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, because sugar is forbidden for children...</p>
<p>and because sugar is unhealthy.</p>
<p>And bad for the teeth. For the stomach, too.</p>
<p>There will be a thunderstorm!</p>
<p>Write: "Dear Mr. Maharajah..."</p>
<p>Mm-mm. "Dear" doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is not a normal letter, it's a blackmailer's letter.</p>
<p>I'm a robber, not a blackmailer!</p>
<p>Then write: "Dear Mr. Maharajah..."</p>
<p>No, too polite.</p>
<p>I'll just write: "Maharajah."</p>
<p>You can draw great letters!</p>
<p>Write: "Maharajah..."</p>
<p>"We've kidnapped your daughter..."</p>
<p>No, no, no...</p>
<p>"We have...kidnapped your daughter..."</p>
<p>Um... "kidnapped..."</p>
<p>Ah, of course. "We kidnapped your daughter."</p>
<p>No, kidnapped...stolen....</p>
<p>Write "kidnapped", et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>"And no police!"</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>How did it go on?</p>
<p>"Maharajah..."</p>
<p>"Maharajah..."</p>
<p>"Maharajah, we've kidnapped your daughter."</p>
<p>No, no, "we have kidnapped your daughter."</p>
<p>"...Kidnapped."</p>
<p>Of course, it would be, "We have kidnapped your daughter."</p>
<p>No, kidnapped!</p>
<p>Kidnapped. No, write kidnapped!</p>
<p>"And no police!"</p>
<p>Understand? - "Po-li-zei."</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>I don't feel like it anymore. I'm out of here!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>We're leaving. You're coming with us.</p>
<p>But Auntie said we can't run away.</p>
<p>If we do, we'll be like those three brothers who ran away.</p>
<p>They were eaten by wolves.</p>
<p>And when the moon is full, you can still hear them screaming.</p>
<p>Are you really so stupid as to believe that?</p>
<p>Come on, Nikolas. Here, the sheets. Quick!</p>
<p>Ouch, it's your foot! Watch out!</p>
<p>An escape attempt.</p>
<p>How cute!</p>
<p>They're way too weak for the outside world.</p>
<p>They're coming back.</p>
<p>Quick!</p>
<p>Tell me, Tiffany, where do you learn that?</p>
<p>My mommy taught me!</p>
<p>I wish I could do that too. Write.</p>
<p>I can show you.</p>
<p>Me? With fingers like these?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure!</p>
<p>Wouldn't be bad to be able to write, of course.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And I could write my "mamuars" then. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Donnerjakob!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Huh? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>"Memoirs. "</p>
<p>Donnerjakob: My life as a robber.</p>
<p>Halt!</p>
<p>That's the forest mailbox.</p>
<p>And now off, the mail.</p>
<p>Will anyone find it?</p>
<p>Of course! Everybody comes here! Everybody!</p>
<p>My magnificent...</p>
<p>beet sugar machine!</p>
<p>What am I in the mood for?</p>
<p>A buttercream cake?</p>
<p>No. Peppermint candy?</p>
<p>No, no...a candy cane.</p>
<p>Candy cane, a candy cane....</p>
<p>And for dessert...</p>
<p>A jam layer cake.</p>
<p>Mmmmm, dessert!</p>
<p>So, the letter is gone!</p>
<p>Then we'll finally have our gold in two weeks.</p>
<p>And then I'll be free and can finally go.</p>
<p>Heißa-juchei.</p>
<p>That's right. Isn't that swell?</p>
<p>And you'll be back home...</p>
<p>...with your daddy in In-in-in-India.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'd be nice, home...</p>
<p>in our golden palace.</p>
<p>With my three brothers.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have brothers? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have brothers?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Three of them? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes!</p>
<p>And what brothers!</p>
<p>One of them always plays hide and seek with me as long as I want!</p>
<p>When I'm tired, the other one shows me...</p>
<p>some new elephant tricks.</p>
<p>Sit!</p>
<p>And the third one,</p>
<p>he even has a flying carpet!</p>
<p>And we fly until we...</p>
<p>Enough with the... with the banter! We have to go to work!</p>
<p>Oh, yes, work...</p>
<p>Come on, brothers.</p>
<p>And we'll bring you a little something.</p>
<p>Ah, what a beautiful night!</p>
<p>Thunderjakob!</p>
<p>Good luck and a fat booty!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tiffany... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes?</p>
<p>Make yourself comfortable!</p>
<p>Yeah, make yourself at home. Make yourself at home.</p>
<p>Flying carpet, pah!</p>
<p>I'm hungry!</p>
<p>Hear that? What's that?</p>
<p>Shut up, I don't hear anything.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just fireflies.</p>
<p>Look out! Look out!</p>
<p>Put your foot there...</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!</p>
<p>That was close.</p>
<p>Teddy bear, teddy bear, you're out!</p>
<p>Teddy bear, teddy bear, run home!</p>
<p>Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around.</p>
<p>Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around</p>
<p>Teddy bear, teddy bear, how old are you?</p>
<p>One hundred and five!</p>
<p>One, two, three...</p>
<p>four, five...</p>
<p>six...</p>
<p>I'm a little Indian princess.</p>
<p>Look at that!</p>
<p>A real little robberess.</p>
<p>You've got a lot of gold!</p>
<p>What are you doing with it?</p>
<p>Uh... rob.</p>
<p>Why? Why?</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>If you robbed it, what do you do with it?</p>
<p>Do what?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's just lying here.</p>
<p>In our treasury.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is where we put it. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>m-hmm.</p>
<p>And we brought something for you too, princess.</p>
<p>A little something.</p>
<p>But don't break it!</p>
<p>Oh, you darlings!</p>
<p>I don't know how to play the piano.</p>
<p>Here we go, brothers!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>To the instruments! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, yes!</p>
<p>I want too! I want an instrument too! Flinn, please, please!</p>
<p>Here, take this.</p>
<p>You're only on it three times!</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p>Now, now.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Well, it's much nicer out here in the dark forest...</p>
<p>than in the orphanage.</p>
<p>Huh, Nikolas?</p>
<p>And tomorrow we'll gather wood in time,</p>
<p>so we can have a campfire at night.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good night, Nikolas. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good night, Gregory.</p>
<p>Sleep...</p>
<p>Sleep, my sweet little children.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll go back to the beets!</p>
<p>You must be rested!</p>
<p>Sweet dreams...</p>
<p>No turnip, no love.</p>
<p>Sleep...</p>
<p>Sleep...</p>
<p>soundly.</p>
<p>This is the second night.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Woodpecker, that's it.</p>
<p>I've warned you often enough.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing you up for disturbing the peace.</p>
<p>Charges against Woodpecker...</p>
<p>Name?</p>
<p>Good morning, dear robbers!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, princess. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Tiffany.</p>
<p>Today we'll learn to read and write.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, yes! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Great!</p>
<p>Begin!</p>
<p>And so the ABC's go...</p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, that's... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, I can write! Check it out!</p>
<p>Hey, I can read!</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident..."</p>
<p>"that all men are created equal."</p>
<p>"...And that they have received from their Creator certain..."</p>
<p>Hmph, pig claw. "...inalienable rights..."</p>
<p>"...among which are life, liberty, and..."</p>
<p>"...the pursuit of happiness."</p>
<p>Guys, that's an even one!</p>
<p>I'm not writing it down. They don't exist.</p>
<p>They're just a figment of my wild imagination.</p>
<p>I'm hungry.</p>
<p>Look! Berries! - Wow!</p>
<p>Mmm, yummy!</p>
<p>Yuck! Turnip grease...</p>
<p>Gross!</p>
<p>An egg whipped sugar</p>
<p>Caramel strawberry cream pie!</p>
<p>Yummy yummy yummy!</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, what you're doing is clearly...</p>
<p>public nuisance and...</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm warning you...</p>
<p>Oh, boy!</p>
<p>Look, isn't that the gendarme?</p>
<p>He sees nothing and hears nothing.</p>
<p>We can rob in peace.</p>
<p>He's probably writing down a few checks right now.</p>
<p>For speeding!</p>
<p>What a jerk!</p>
<p>Hello, Tiffany!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Marchy ma kullo!</p>
<p>I always knew it!</p>
<p>That looks like Tiffany!</p>
<p>We can read now.</p>
<p>Yeah, read it!</p>
<p>"Ti-ffa-ny... "</p>
<p>Tiffany!</p>
<p>A wanted poster.</p>
<p>Maybe she has...maybe Tiffany has a twin sister?</p>
<p>Of course, and her name is also Tiffany!</p>
<p>Well, it's possible.</p>
<p>"Wanted."</p>
<p>She is wanted. Tiffany is wanted, like us.</p>
<p>Yes, wanted. "The orphan Tiffany."</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Orphan? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>An orphan?</p>
<p>So she doesn't have any parents.</p>
<p>But then there would be no majarajah.</p>
<p>No elephants, no brothers...</p>
<p>And no penny ransom gold!</p>
<p>Good evening, dear robbers.</p>
<p>Have you robbed anything today?</p>
<p>What does it say?</p>
<p>It says, "Wanted."</p>
<p>"The orphan... Tiffany. "</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>"Wanted... The orphan... Tiffany... "</p>
<p>You think...</p>
<p>You can nest here like a maggot in bacon,</p>
<p>eat the hair off our heads and make a mess of everything?</p>
<p>I wanted to be a robber too.</p>
<p>You think we're stupid, don't you?</p>
<p>We're just the stupid robbers.</p>
<p>We won't let ourselves be pushed around by an orphan.</p>
<p>Grigou...</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I'm an orphan.</p>
<p>No gold, worth nothing. And now...</p>
<p>I'm going to an orphanage.</p>
<p>I guess that's where orphans belong.</p>
<p>Tiffany, you can't...</p>
<p>Goodbye, Thunderjakob.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.</p>
<p>Grigou, for God's sake,</p>
<p>The child is going!</p>
<p>To the orphanage.</p>
<p>Grigou, Tiffany is going to the orphanage!</p>
<p>Wonderful... such peace!</p>
<p>Great, the silence. Nice and quiet.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thunderjakob... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What?</p>
<p>Oh, I see...</p>
<p>Hey, Grigou, little Tiffany is alone in the forest...</p>
<p>She doesn't have her doll with her.</p>
<p>Should she just go... there, there... to the orphanage?</p>
<p>Leave me alone! It's the middle of the night!</p>
<p>And what do I care about that lying weasel?</p>
<p>That's right. You're... you're right, Grigou.</p>
<p>What do you care about those kids? They're just orphans!</p>
<p>Grigou... "No beetroots, no love!"</p>
<p>For God's sake!</p>
<p>Marchy ma kullo!</p>
<p>Fireflies, Nikolas. They're all just fireflies.</p>
<p>We're surrounded by itty bitty cute fireflies.</p>
<p>Good evening...</p>
<p>A girl!</p>
<p>Just an ordinary little girl.</p>
<p>I think you're an orphan.</p>
<p>I am an orphan. How do you know?</p>
<p>Because the night before last...</p>
<p>a little girl was stolen from the carriage.</p>
<p>We're orphans too. We ran away.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>My name is Gregory. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And I'm Nikolas.</p>
<p>And you?</p>
<p>Tiffany.</p>
<p>This is the third night.</p>
<p>We were orphans.</p>
<p>Because now we are free and we want to see the big world.</p>
<p>The world is waiting for us!</p>
<p>Nobody waits for me.</p>
<p>And I don't want the world either, I already know it.</p>
<p>It'll stop. After a while it doesn't hurt anymore.</p>
<p>Here. I give you.</p>
<p>I don't believe it! Did you steal from someone?</p>
<p>I already stole. I'm not stealing.</p>
<p>I think I'm crazy!</p>
<p>We're rich! We can live on it!</p>
<p>We'll buy a house! No, better yet, a boat!</p>
<p>And then we'll drive around all the time!</p>
<p>Or a carriage with a sleeping cabin.</p>
<p>Nonsense: a carriage and a boat.</p>
<p>Gold, gold, gold... I don't give a damn about gold!</p>
<p>The robbers only took me because they wanted more and more gold!</p>
<p>Robbers?</p>
<p>They don't give a damn that I'm an orphan.</p>
<p>What do they know about being all alone?</p>
<p>Hey, where are you going?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I'm going to the orphanage. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tiffany, you're crazy!</p>
<p>Children who don't have parents anymore, they have to go to an orphanage.</p>
<p>That's how it is.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>The three of us have to stay together! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You can't leave us like this!</p>
<p>Are you going to let that horrible aunt order you around voluntarily?</p>
<p>There, look closely. Do you really want to go there?</p>
<p>At least there are other orphans like us.</p>
<p>If it weren't for that witch, it wouldn't be so bad with the other kids.</p>
<p>How many children live there?</p>
<p>About twenty. Or eighty.</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>Three hundred at least! Or seven hundred and sixty-five!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And only one aunt? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>One.</p>
<p>Only one aunt...</p>
<p>But she's dangerous as hell.</p>
<p>She lives at the top of the tower.</p>
<p>God knows what she's doing up there.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Yes, I see her!</p>
<p>She's really going to the orphanage!</p>
<p>There are two others too.</p>
<p>We have to go there, Grigou!</p>
<p>I... I can't, brothers.</p>
<p>...to the orphanage.</p>
<p>To the evil aunt.</p>
<p>I don't dare.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm scared.</p>
<p>Together we can do it. It's about Tiffany.</p>
<p>What, thunderjacks?</p>
<p>Flinn is right, brother. Let's go!</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Shh, quiet! So no one hears us.</p>
<p>The kids are all asleep.</p>
<p>The children are all asleep. They're dead tired from working in the beet field.</p>
<p>Auntie is always awake.</p>
<p>She sits in her tower room at night...</p>
<p>and you hear strange noises.</p>
<p>Like: "Knark-knark-knark" and stuff like that.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You have to watch out for the coachman. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Why?</p>
<p>He's always lying in corners.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Then he strikes. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You don't suspect anything bad.</p>
<p>To the aunt's room! Follow me!</p>
<p>We... better stay outside.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>We'll keep a lookout. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Shit bunnies!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>See you in a minute. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>See you in a minute.</p>
<p>Here's a... chocolate.</p>
<p>And another chocolate!</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>I don't believe it!</p>
<p>I don't believe it!</p>
<p>Welcome, dear viewers...</p>
<p>to the screening of..:</p>
<p>"The World's Dumbest Orphans!"</p>
<p>My dear Nikolas.</p>
<p>Dearest Gregory.</p>
<p>So you would like to apply?</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>And you're really dumb enough?</p>
<p>Let's see then. It'll be fun!</p>
<p>I'll sing and you dance.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>In the forest, there are robbers...</p>
<p>Hello... Hello...</p>
<p>Who was that?!</p>
<p>There are more up here! The whole room is full of cakes!</p>
<p>They're piled up to the ceiling!</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>Quick, Tiffany, you have to run!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>Put me down, you monster!</p>
<p>Let me go! Aaah!</p>
<p>What a naughty little thing!</p>
<p>Get her!</p>
<p>The three robbers... in my castle!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>You have no business here, I rule!</p>
<p>Get out of my orphanage!</p>
<p>Or I'll call the police!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what I like: racing in the woods!</p>
<p>I'm going to fine you for speeding...</p>
<p>They're gone.</p>
<p>I don't believe it!</p>
<p>That sly little Grigou...</p>
<p>and his two brothers!</p>
<p>That stupid Thunderjakob, and...</p>
<p>and that idiot Flinn!</p>
<p>Well, you runaways, you've grown up so much.</p>
<p>Well, after thirty years.</p>
<p>We brought your doll, Tiffany.</p>
<p>Pimpanella. You forgot it, Tiffany.</p>
<p>Besides, we were wondering if you...</p>
<p>...if you could...</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>...if you were coming back to us.</p>
<p>We... uh... miss you.</p>
<p>Life is so colorful</p>
<p>when you're around.</p>
<p>And your...</p>
<p>And your laugh, you know, it tickles so nicely...</p>
<p>in the robber's ears. Yes.</p>
<p>Ah, Grigou!</p>
<p>Well, well, well!</p>
<p>I'm sure I have something to say about that.</p>
<p>The orphan paragraph reads:</p>
<p>Parentless children...</p>
<p>belong in an orphanage.</p>
<p>Patsch.</p>
<p>I get it!</p>
<p>There's no room for evil in this movie!</p>
<p>Then I can go! Huh? Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>I'm going!</p>
<p>Ungrateful vermin!</p>
<p>You'll never see me again!</p>
<p>That's what you get!</p>
<p>And finally, I'd like to wish for a cannonball...</p>
<p>Ah, nonsense! ...ice cream bomb!</p>
<p>Yummy-yummy-yummy-yummy.</p>
<p>That tickles!</p>
<p>I feel dizzy...</p>
<p>Dizzy, dizzy!</p>
<p>Farewell, you ungrateful brats!</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Robber hats? Robber hats!</p>
<p>Where there are bandits' hats, there are bandits.</p>
<p>Attention! Listen up!</p>
<p>Robbers, step forward!</p>
<p>There are no robbers here, Mr. Gendarme. Only orphans.</p>
<p>And where is the head of the orphanage?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Uh... away. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's right, she's gone!</p>
<p>She's disappeared.</p>
<p>We can't get her back.</p>
<p>It's a discontinued model.</p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p>This house is ours now!</p>
<p>That's not correct...</p>
<p>This house is municipal property.</p>
<p>I'm in charge now.</p>
<p>We'll buy the house.</p>
<p>Nikolas, the daler.</p>
<p>That's very kind of you, children.</p>
<p>But I'm afraid it's not enough.</p>
<p>And then the robbers took a little bit of gold...</p>
<p>And they bought the house for the children</p>
<p>The story got around very quickly</p>
<p>And that's why it's over.</p>
<p>Many a day a child lay at the orphanage gate</p>
<p>And they helped him in his need</p>
<p>And the crowd of children grew and wore coats and hats</p>
<p>Like the robbers, the three of them, only in red</p>
<p>And there was a laugh that went through the air</p>
<p>And filled the whole house</p>
<p>From the windows in the house children looked out,</p>
<p>Happy children looked out.</p>
<p>And a child first grows up and then really old</p>
<p>And a girl becomes a woman, a boy a man.</p>
<p>And the men and women soon marry</p>
<p>And make new children</p>
<p>Then they built themselves houses nearby.</p>
<p>Soon it was a whole little town with....</p>
<p>People all wearing red hats...</p>
<p>And red coats.</p>
<p>Finally, they built a city wall...</p>
<p>with three mighty towers,</p>
<p>one for each robber...</p>
<p>out of gratitude.</p>
<p>We are the icy dark figures</p>
<p>creeping through the night</p>
<p>Gold and money and precious stones we rob and it laughs</p>
<p>the pale moon in the misty light, when our rifle cracks.</p>
<p>So pay attention, hand over everything, otherwise we'll hit you on the roof.</p>
<p>Robbing is child's play, no one plays it like us</p>
<p>The rifle bangs the bellows blows pepper against the animals</p>
<p>Then the coach stands dead still, welcome to the last part</p>
<p>The spokes of the carriage wheel crackle under our axe</p>
<p>Will anyone find him?</p>
<p>Of course! Everybody passes by here! Everybody!</p>
<p>Robbery is a child's game, no one plays it like we do</p>
<p>The rifle bangs, the bellows blow pepper against the animals</p>
<p>Then the carriage stands dead still, welcome to the last part</p>
<p>The spokes of the carriage wheel crack under our axe</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, surrender at once, otherwise it's over</p>
<p>We'll sharpen the knives then they better cut out your little heart</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, surrender now, or else it's over</p>
<p>We'll sharpen the knives, then they'd better separate</p>
<p>Your throat in two</p>
<p>We are at home in our robber's nest, hidden deep in the forest.</p>
<p>The gold is gone, we don't care, we'll get more soon.</p>
<p>Hold it right there! Hands up, this is a robbery</p>
<p>We'll take everything that glitters.</p>
<p>We steal from young and old</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, surrender now, otherwise it's over.</p>
<p>We sharpen the knives, then they better cut out your little heart</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, surrender now, or else it's over</p>
<p>We'll sharpen the knives, they'd better part</p>
<p>Your throat in two</p>
<p>I'll puke on Hotzenplotz, that's a little mouse fart.</p>
<p>Here in the forest we are the law and your trial will be short.</p>
<p>We laugh at the gendarmes, we spare the poor, the king's army is afraid.</p>
<p>We'll get the bulging bag from the fat nobleman's belly.</p>
<p>Baboom, baboom, we'll surrender in a moment, take everything you want from us.</p>
<p>But spare our lives, we won't give them, here you are, take our gold.</p>
<p>Marchi ma kullo!</p>
<p>And what does "marschi ma kullo" mean?</p>
<p>It means...well, it's a swear word....</p>
<p>It means...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Kiss my a-!</p>
<p>That's right, that's what it means.</p>
<p>Marschi ma kullo!</p>
