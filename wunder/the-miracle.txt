Alemannia Aachen 1, Rot-Weiss Essen...
Zero.
- Man!
Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and bless what you have given us.
Amen. What about the teaching position?
- I didn't go there.
Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean?
- That I was not there.
For weeks I beg Hartwig, and you don't even go?
I don't work for a man who supported the Nazis!
On weekends, you help out in the business!
- That's where we practice "negro music."
Forget it, you're working, period!
- Don't treat me like a child!
What’s the matter with you Mattes? Eat something!
- Not hungry.
But afterwards there's nothing more.
- Rot-Weiss Essen lost, Mom.
So what? They always lose.
- Bullshit!
It's not so bad after all.
- Oh, mama!
Lost 1 0... What a bummer!
And that against Aachen!
What's up, Atze? Come here, it tastes good. You can see that.
Eat Blacky too.
We'll never be German champions in our lifetime.
Day together.
- Good luck!
That looks good. I need a refill. Smells good!
- I still get money for the last time.
Tomorrow I'll collect from the band, then you'll get it.
Band?
'A band. "Band" sounds better.
- Don't forget your homework.
I have already done that.
- So, have you digested your defeat yet?
Right.
- Christa?
Will you make me another one?
- Don't you have enough already?
One more to go. Say a sentence with "Hamama" and "Hattata".
"When we went for a bike ride once, it rained there."
My mom wanted to know when you were going to pay your lid.
Don't get fat here. You're worse than your age.
My old man has been in Russia for 11 years. And as long as that's the case, I'll do the fat one here. So, when?
As soon as I have work. You can count on it.
It's a word.
So. I have to go to practice now.
Handball?
Very funny.
Ouch! Fucking shit!
Are you trying to kill me, fart knot?
- Sorry, but we are late!
Late? For what?
- For training.
What day is it today?
- Tuesday.
What time?
Half past four.
- Ok. Fifteen minutes.
Gee, boss, you look terrible.
- Yesterday was a bit late.
We had... we had a meeting.
- A meeting? About what?
I forgot.
We really need to hurry.
- You're a real pest, Mattes. First I am almost stoned and then still rushed.
Can't you ring the bell normally? Your predecessor, Micha, was on his toes!
After every big game he stood there with two bottles of ice-cold beer.
Hey, pellet. Are you offended now?
- Nah, but...
You might get another carrier if I don't do it well enough.
Don't talk nonsense, Mattes! You're my mascot!
I only win if you're there!
We saw that again in Aachen.
You probably don't think so. But it's true, really.
Whenever you're around, I can always turn the close games around.
Every time! Okay? Come on, then.
Hurry up! Otherwise I'll have to pay 50 pfennigs into the team's coffers.
Exactly.
(music)
Man, man, man!
How the boss creeps across a square... Old man is not an express-train, Willi.
(Willi) No wonder they lose in Aachen.
Man, man, man!
My grandma would have sunk it too.
Helmut, you bottle, you can't even hit a furniture truck from 3 meters!
I heard that, Willi!
(music)
Where have you been for so long?
What's wrong?
She didn't want to open it until all the men were there.
And if he is dead?
Soon we will be a real family again.
What?
Are you not happy at all?
Yes, it is.
Now Wewetzer comes through the middle, plays to Paetz, who passes to Kruhl!
He shoots... and goal! Goal!
Goal by Kruhl in the 81st minute!
This is the decision here in Hamburg's Volkspark Stadium!
What's the score? - 4 1.
Not bad.
Yes, but for Hanover.
What?
Word of honor!
Hannover leads against Kaiserslautern 4 1?
Yes, yes!
And now there are gloating calls here for Sepp Herberger.
Because with FCK, the team that is the backbone of his national eleven is losing!
Oh dear, this is a difficult hour for the national coach!
It was also a difficult hour for Annette Ackermann, née von Hadding.
Annette...
Hello, gentlemen.
Well, are we off already?
No, of course not. Sorry.
What do you actually have against soccer?
I mean, I'm a sports journalist.
You also have your good side.
Come with us to the stadium, to 1860!
That's all I needed. Oh, here! I've been looking for this all the time.
- What is it?
Morocco.
Father donates us a honeymoon in addition to the house.
Are you coming? If you have time between two soccer broadcasts.
You proposed, I accepted, and we got married.
True.
Besides, we might as well go to Egypt and see the pyramids.
Is this a vacation or a crusade?
I knew you would be happy.
(music)
Will you take the bread, please?
What if he's not there again?
Don't drive me crazy!
I'm nervous enough as it is.
If only he's okay.
Who knows what the Russian did to him.
"The Russian" kicked "the German's"...ass because "the German" attacked him for no reason.
Here!
(music)
Karl-Heinz.
Christa.
I... I am Ingrid.
And who is he?
I had written to you about him.
I never got a letter.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Matthias came after you had to go back to the front.
9 months after you had to go back.
You talk when you're asked.
And it's named after my father?
There. That's it!
We closed today because of you, of course.
And it's only five minutes by bike to the colliery.
You're standing behind the counter here?
Yes, and Ingrid helps as a waitress.
And Bruno?
Not me. I am a musician.
Musicians! So...
Yes.
And who is that?
This is the boss.
Actually, his name is Helmut Rahn and...
And plays for Rot-Weiss Essen.
He is even a national player, and he is my best friend.
Soon it will be the World Cup and...
Your best friend.
I carry his bag and in return I get free entry.
He's kind of a father figure to him.
The children are completely... It's time they learned some real discipline again.
I had so little time for them because of the bar and all....
That will be different once I have my compensation.
I'll be starting again soon on shaft 4.
I can feed my family myself.
We can then sell the pub.
Give me a little more time, Christa.
Ackermann! Congratulations belatedly.
Good morning, Mr. Ahrens. Thank you.
Is wife already in other circumstances?
Not yet. But we practice diligently.
Beautiful. But be careful. Women are the natural enemy of soccer.
As the years go by, the nagging becomes less.
Ackermann, I have a problem here.
Yes?
I need a good man for Switzerland.
For the World Cup?
Exactly.
I thought Schwerdtfeger was doing that.
He's out of Herberger's league.
After the commentary on the Saarland match.
So I need a man down there who has a clean slate and talent to boot.
You mean... me?
And a quick perception.
(music)
Everywhere you look nothing!
Honey! Finally. Help me choose.
I have to tell you something, Annette. The honeymoon falls through. Ahrens ordered me to the World Cup.
That is not true.
This is a unique opportunity. I can't pass it up.
Are you telling me in all seriousness that this brawl is more important than the honeymoon with your wife?
24 guys running after a single ball?
22.
22 for all I care.
It would be boring if everyone had a ball.
All right, Ackermann.
What does "All right" mean?
You can drive.
Ah yes?
On one condition.
And what would that be?
I will come with you.
Come on, pellet, I'll be back soon.
Can't I come with you after all?
You can't sleep under my bed.
I'm in the same room with Fritz Walter.
When you snore, he sleeps badly. And then he plays badly. And then we lose and are eliminated.
Do you want that?
- Nope.
You said you can't win the big games without me.
True. Nevertheless, that's not possible. What would your father say?
I would rather have you as my father.
Don't say that, Mattes. Your father's going through a hard time, and he needs you here now. I'm sure things will get better soon.
Good. Then read again, but slowly and to enjoy, yes?
"Dear sports comrades. We are pleased to be able to inform you that we can expect you in good health and well prepared, on Wednesday, 26.5. 1954, at the Munich-Grünwald Sports School.
Players are entitled to loss of earnings only for the time the team is in competition. With sporting regards, i. A. Passler"
Hopefully they have enough mosquitoes with them.
Time to leave. Come.
(locomotive whistle)
Good luck, boss.
You too, fart knot.
(conductor)
Caution, please!
We welcome here in the studio our national goalkeeper Anton Turek.
He is only called Toni and has brought us something for the benefit of the late returnees...from Russian captivity. Toni.
Yes. I have here an original World Cup ball.
All the fellows of Fortuna Düsseldorf have signed on it.
We hope that a nice sum will come out of it for the homecomers....and keep our fingers crossed for all participants from here.
And I would be very happy if one or the other fellow...with your help could find his way again a little easier in the homeland.
Yes.
Yes.
It doesn't work with the reception!
I'd better return the expensive thing.
If you want to compete with Kessler, you have to keep this thing.
Men are crazy about soccer. Just take your moronic son.
He thinks Rahn won't win without him.
Just not the important games!
...for the last training session before the World Cup finals in Switzerland.
In the storm always in front and so also immediately the first from the bus
Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...and Berni Klodt from Schalke 04.
Toni Turek from Fortuna Düsseldorf...between Heinz Kubsch from FK Pirmasens and Heinrich Kwiatkowski from BVB.
Assistant coach Albert Sing sends Ottmar Walter of 1. FCK...
and Herbert Erhard from SpVgg Fürth through the course.
These two will probably go to bed with a buzzing head.
Karlheinz Metzner from KSV Hessen Kassel and Uli Biesinger from BC Augsburg.
At home they are local rivals, but here they strengthen each other to really overturn the Hungarians.
Alfred Pfaff of Eintracht Frankfurt...and Richard Hermann of FSV Frankfurt.
And that will certainly earn the respect of our preliminary round opponents...for sure. Paul Mebus from 1. FC Köln shows his footwork, and teammate Hans Schäfer wants to be in no way inferior to him.
During a cheerful game of cards Werner Liebrich, Horst Eckel and Werner Kohlmeyer from Lauter recover from the exhausting training...
The Bavarians are a bit more comfortable. Karl Mai from SpVgg Fürth...and Hans Bauer from Bayern Munich.
Fritz Laband and Jupp Posipal, both of HSV, are currently completing what is probably the most pleasant training session: that of signing autographs.
But isn't there another one missing?
Of course, the captain! And there he is: Fritz Walter from 1. FC Kaiserslautern.
Bravo, Mr. Walter.
Smile for me. There you go.
And here once again the entire squad.
Good luck, guys!
The homeland keeps its fingers crossed for you.
Welcome home, Richard.
Thank you.
It's good to have you back.
A lot has changed down here.
Good luck.
Good luck.
(Screams)
(music)
Men, in two weeks in Switzerland we want to make a good impression.
Unfortunately, I still see glaring physical deficiencies in some of you.
So we will do more gymnastics.
We start with push-ups.
(music)
You see, you have to work on yourselves.
Use the course to train hard.
Work on your weaknesses, but also train what you can.
As the saying goes, " Oh, how soon beauty and form fade away."
Beautiful you are not, so at least fight for the rest.
'brigens, Metzner, you are an outstanding soccer player.
But you smoke secretly, and by doing so you betray your comrades.
Because you would be even better otherwise.
That is why you are still going home today.
Wasn't that a bit harsh?
Of course. He's still allowed to stay, but they have to know where they're going.
Now let's see what you've got, Adi.
Is lighter than its predecessor.
True. But it is not.
Don't make it so exciting.
Screws...
Exactly. Studs with screw thread.
Screws!
Brilliant!
The right length for any weather.
Yes, yes, they fit perfectly. Of course they do.
They are screwed on.
So?
I want two complete sets
for the world championship!
Listen carefully. I hereby forbid you to have any contact with soldiers.
But I just wanted to go with a friend....
I forbid you to get all dolled up.
That's not true. I just wanted to...
As long as you live under my roof, there are certain rules for you.
You'll abide by them, right?
(Peter)
Tip, top, tip, tip.
Good, then I'll take the Lang.
Then Akki and Nolden come to me.
Then we take the Mischa and the Buri.
I will then take the Rainer and the Carola.
And you still get the Lubanski.
Nah, we get Carola and her Mattes.
All right.
But next time you'll get this.
(music)
Hey! You're playing with us, man!
Goal!
(music)
Set with "x".
It was probably nothing.
Mom said you used to play soccer too.
Nope.
I am also only allowed to play if they are odd.
The girl was not bad at all.
Carola. I can never get past her, not even with the best tricks from the boss.
Because you can't play like that.
You imitate his tricks, his style, but it's not your style.
And what is my style?
You're tough and you can run.
You run more than the others.
You are a defender.
No one will respect the bad copy of a star.
(vocals)
Werner Liebrich, Werner Liebrich, are you still sleeping?
Are you still asleep?
Do you not hear the bells?
Do you not hear the bells?
Ding, ding, dong.
Ding, ding, dong.
Is that a breeze. They should do that in cans and send it.
And if you run out of steam in the game, open up a snooze, Kohli.
Look at the boats there, you can sail around on the lake.
These are pedalos, Otto, not boats.
You'll only find them in Kaiserslautern.
Berni, the Urus train on the same field as we do!
Really? Us and the defending champion!
(Rahn) Guys, I'm starting to get the tingles.
Your wife put it together so nicely and you stuff it in the closet like that!
How do you distinguish old from fresh?
I smell it. How do you do that?
There you go! The Swiss can not only build watches.
What does the boss want to punish me for, being in the room with you?
Do you think he'll take me to the first game against the Turks? I'm in top shape.
Here we go again?
All right. Yes, he'll take you.
Berni Klodt is also in good shape.
Maybe he'll take him.
Yes, you're right. He'll take Berni.
Friedrich. That's fun now, isn't it?
You know what? I'm going to take a shower.
Funny guy.
(music)
Let me guess. You don't like it.
Well, soccer reporters...
I always associate it with misery.
The suite was booked for Schwerdtfeger.
I am sure that otherwise I would have been accommodated under a bridge. - Oh well.
So, the opening match will be between Yugoslavia and France? - Yes.
And who do we stand by?
As reporters, we have to be neutral.
And with Germany against Turkey?
Of course, we stand by Germany in this respect.
Aren't we reporters there?
Yes, it is.
Isn't that a bit irrational?
Can be, yes.
Like me sometimes?
Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...now and at the hour of our death.
(music)
Gentlemen, here we go at last.
We are playing against Turkey.
The Turks have knocked out Spain.
So we must not underestimate them.
Let's move on to the lineup
Toni, you play in goal.
In the defensive line: Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in the halfback line: Eckel and Mai, in the half positions: Morlock and Fritz, in the forward on the left Hans Schäfer, in the center Ottmar, on the right outside...Berni Klodt. Departure is in two hours.
I expect punctuality.
(music)
Goal! 4 1 won!
Well played, Matthias.
Well, Mr. Lubanski, that the government pays compensation to the war returnees is correct. But your number of years is not correct.
- Nope. You don't make a mistake with that (of the number of years imprisoned). 11 years and 4 months.
- According to my records, you were sentenced in the Soviet Republic for aggravated theft and sabotage for additional years. This can then no longer be counted as a prisoner of war. And so you have no further entitlement to compensation for this period. :
We stole a can of brown sugar because we were dying!
I don't doubt that, Mr Lubanski. However, that doesn't change the facts.
Hundreds I was allowed to watch! Sabotage, theft, it was all a joke!
I didn't make the rules.
And you are not the first to complain. At the same time, you can still be glad that...
- Be happy? I can be happy? You know who can be happy? You! Because you haven't spent a day in Russia! And you can be glad that I don't beat your face in!
The Hungarians seem surprised by the lineup of the German team, but they will care little.
50 penny.
What, pay admission?
You take it from the living.
(TV commentary continues)
Well? Everything clear?
Nothing is clear at all.
Herberger lets the substitutes play.
Careless ball...
What are you doing?
Goal!
I knew it. I knew it!
What a shit!
Why doesn't Kwiatkowski
not hold on to the ball? - Matthias?
Will you come here?
A very bad start!
Go ahead and sit down.
Can you sell me a cigarette?
Right.
Here, I give you.
Thank you.
Yes!
I saw you there in the church.
You lit a candle.
Will you also tell me for whom?
Come on, say it.
For Helmut Rahn.
Helmut Rahn?
Herberger usually does not put him up.
That's when I thought I had to do something.
Come outside.
You light a candle in church, just so some ball kicker can...
doesn't have to sit on the bench?
Rahn is not just some ball kicker!
He is the best!
Are you crazy? You are abusing the church!
Off home!
Think about the meaning of the church!
But...
Stop it now. And don't you start crying!
A German boy does not cry.
What's going on?
None of your business.
One may well still ask.
Shut up and get back inside. Go!
(Sad Music)
Did you hear that?
"A German boy does not cry."
I wish he had never come back.
Come on, Alfred, hurry up! Come down!
Yes.
8 3.
What an embarrassment.
And only Herberger is to blame!
I don't know what's wrong with you.
I think it's very clever.
Do you find.
Yes, he is sparing his important people for the decisive match against the Turks.
That's what I would have done.
Well, if that doesn't make Seppl happy...
Another cold drink?
What's going on?
Three pilsners. And three in stock!
Do not look. These are players from the German national team.
So what?
They drink one, just like us.
Do you think Herberger will let them go on a booze cruise during the tournament?
Oh! You mean they escaped?
Yes.
Let's dance unobtrusively a little closer so we can hear what they're saying.
Eight pieces! And?
How do you feel about being a stopgap?
We were good enough for the dirty work, but watch this
Next time they will do without us.
You still have it good.
At least everyone scored a goal.
I only got myself a few bruises.
Still can't perform properly.
So what? Let's wash down the annoyance.
But right. Must be worth it if the old man catches us. Cheers.
(music)
(music)
(Sings)
Home we will not go...
My God, he's heavy!
These are the muscles.
How?
Just look at those thighs.
Every single muscle is trained there.
Yes, yes. It's okay.
Who are you, buddy?
Ackermann, Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Great sports section.
Thank you.
And you, madam?
His wife.
Too bad.
We'll leave him here and get out of here.
And we'll call the doorman, honey.
Otherwise, they'll drag us into it.
What thighs.
What a story.
Dare or I'll divorce you.
Then I dare.
(music)
Stop.
Hello, Mr. Herberger.
Greetings.
Sorry, I was cleaning.
I would be very grateful if you did not run over it.
Cleaned at the time?
When else?
May I sit here until the ground is dry?
Sure.
Did you lose today?
And how!
And you are no longer in the competition?
Yes, we did. We lost a battle, not the war.
Tell me, young lady, do you have children?
Me?
Nine pieces! And you?
22. And one of them gives me great trouble.
Surely your favorite child.
They always make the most ƒrger.
That makes it especially difficult to punish him. - Oh, nonsense.
How?
Garbage. Rubbish. Bullshit.
You are not in Germany now, there is no need to punish all the time.
Whoever is not for me is against me.
You also have to let 5 be straight sometimes.
No sweet without the sweet.
When the apple is ripe, it falls from the tree by itself.
Early bird catches the worm.
The ball is round, and a game lasts 90 minutes.
(music)
Tell me, are you stupid?
It can be. Why?
The boss will send you home if he gets wind of it.
And so what?
One less substitute player in Switzerland.
We are one team, no matter what!
And we need you like everyone else!
It's too late now anyway.
Dassler found me in front of the hotel.
Helmut, I want to know one thing from you :
Are you for us or are you against us?
How can I understand the question?
If you're for us, I'll talk to Adi, but if something like this happens again, I'll kick your ass personally.
I don't know you like that, Fritz.
Are you serious?
Of course I'm for you, damn it! - Good.
(Station Announcement)
Come now!
Do you know where I've been looking for you?
Switzerland, my ass.
You'll be grounded for a week.
Pants down. - How?
pants down!
Bend over!
Richard! Stop it now!
Let me!
Do you want to beat him bloody?
Are you standing against me, too?
Well? Are you standing up to me too?
It's not just about you!
Doesn't it matter to you if we're doing well?
Where did your "education" lead?
The big guy is a communist loudmouth, the girl is a soldier's whore, and the little weirdo wants to run away!
Ask yourself why! Because of you!
I just want to teach him discipline so that he is capable and becomes something.
Oh, that's right.
Where do you think I've been for the last few years?
I've brought the family through, built up the pub we live on, done the housework, brought up the children.
Now you come and make everything bad
and restore the "order"!
I'm not saying that everything is bad.
Before you came, Richard, we were almost happy. Since you came, the children are distraught and desperate!
Should I go back to the camp?
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
Can't you think about others just once
think about others for 10 seconds?
Since you've been around, everyone's been dealing non-stop with your moods, your moods, your feelings!
Do you have a word of appreciation for us?
Bruno's music brings money, Ingrid serves, Mattes earns something with the cigarettes!
So much for discipline. And, Richard:
You have the least discipline of all!
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Your questions, please. Mr. Holzmann?
The lineup of Basel, the confusion in the defense...did you want to grab the Hungarians with that?
We have a tough game the day after tomorrow.
The Turks beat South Korea, so we have to play them again.
We have to pass there.
Mr. Ruhpoldt, please.
Eight goals against. Many Germans, and not just the experts, think that you have done serious damage to German soccer.
The ball we're playing with here is Swiss-made.
The last time I saw it, it was still plump and round.
So there is no trace of damage.
(Laughter)
The young colleague there, please.
Mr. Herberger, the defeat against the Hungarians was a shock.
Won't this tactic endanger the cohesion of our team against the Turks?
Is it even possible to coordinate attack and offense now?
Wanted to say :
Defense and defense.
Ahm...
What happens to the midfield?
What will be?
You know, young man: the ball is round and a game lasts 90 minutes.
(Unintelligible conversations)
So, men, the lineup :
Toni in goal, in defense Laband, and Posipal, in the run Bauer, Eckel and Mai, Morlock and Fritz behind Schäfer, Ottmar and Berni Klodt.
Decisive match against Turkey.
You know what it's all about, men.
But before that, I'll read you letters that our compatriots sent me from home...on the occasion of the Hungary game :
"Mr. Herberger, if the national coach doesn't know what to present...to a sports audience in such cases, he should buy a rope...and hang it from the nearest tree, but in such a way that you can still use the rope."
"Herberger, you belong on trial for sabotage!
It would be nice if you would draw the consequences from the events that a decent person would draw
would draw from something like this, which is to resign."
"Herberger must go.
Fifty on the bare soles of his feet, and away with him from Germany.
The traitor no longer belongs to us."
Now get out.
(music)
(Fritz) Chief, what's going on?
We are among the last eight.
Who should I put at right wing?
Berni or the boss?
You are the game leader.
What do you think?
Klodt, Rahn, they're both good.
Each has its own merits.
Berni has played excellently so far.
Harmonizes great with Morlock.
If I let them play together, it's a sweet combination game.
But we can't storm off against Yugoslavia the way we did against the Turks.
That's when you have to play from the defensive.
Maybe the boss would be better there after all.
Let him not play or pass badly.
I have a funny feeling he'll bring the decision.
I think the boss will not disappoint you.
One more disappointment would be
one too many, if you understand.
So watch him a little bit.
Hello, sport.
Day.
How is our prisoner doing?
Sentenced to 5 years of house arrest...for desertion in combination with sabotage of piggy banks?
Watch out: If he hits you again, I'll hit him back. I promise, okay?
Captivity is an emergency situation, as we all know.
One is allowed to use special measures.
If you can't listen to the quarter-final match...Germany vs. Yugoslavia at the cute Carola, it doesn't mean you have to do without it completely.
...announce team lineup :
Turek in goal, Laband and Kohlmeyer in defense, in the halfback line Eckel, Liebrich and Mai play, in the forward line Helmut Rahn.
Rahn plays. He plays!
Food is ready.
What, now?
Better come down right away.
I haven't eaten this well in a long time!
Yes, it was delicious, Dad.
Yes, was edible.
Can I have another piece?
Sure.
Here.
Thank you.
Actually, it's your mother's birthday, but since I've been away for so long, I'd like to give each of you a gift.
a gift to each of you.
Here.
Thank you!
Go ahead, take it.
But that's nice.
It's not from East Berlin, but it works.
Thank you.
Atze, Blacky, I have something to show you!
Atze?
Blacky.
Shot from the dangerous Zebec.
But Toni holds it safely. Bravo, Toni!
Throws the ball now to Laband, who bravely replaces Posipal....
Mr. Tiburski? What's the score?
Still 0 0.
But the Yugos are all partisans.
You can fight them only where they show themselves.
Have you seen my rabbits?
Nah, kid, I didn't.
Wait a minute, it's your mom's birthday.
Yes. Why?
(music)
(Dramatic Music)
('surrenders)
(Bruno)
I thought they were off the market.
As if we have money for that.
Stop shaking your head!
I shake my head as much as I want.
You shut up and obey.
Is that all they taught you?
What do you mean by "you guys"?
Since when am I "you guys" to you?
No matter.
Do you think I'm a Nazi because I spent my best time lying in the dirt?
As an individual, you simply had to be there!
Yes. You are nothing, your people are everything.
How do you actually talk to me?
Don't hit me again.
Did I hold out for 11 years to have my own son make fun of me?
I don't want the ball anymore.
The black and white from Grabitz has young.
If you want, I'll get you two.
I never want rabbits again.
I understand that.
Mom?
Huh?
Was dad like that before?
How?
So mean.
Mattes?
Think about how it hurt you that Atze and Blacky are gone.
Now imagine that this is how you feel every day. For 12 years.
Every day. Can you imagine that?
That's what it must have been like for Dad when he wasn't allowed home. For 12 years.
But I can't help it.
Is it the dad's fault?
You see? We can all do nothing about it.
But we can all help it get better.
Huh? You...
You're a big one, my little one.
Your dad's a big guy, too.
Actually.
If we help him, you'll be amazed at what a great dad you have.
We just need patience, the rest will come by itself.
When we beat Yugoslavia 2-0, we were really lucky.
Was the defensive tactic really right?
And was it right to take out the good Klodt for Rahn?
Rahn scored a goal, all right, but how important is he really?
You have it a little easier than I do.
Your game and that of your colleagues starts when ours is over.
But since we won, I think I did everything right.
Should Jupp Posipal really defend against Austria in the semifinals?
This is how it is planned.
You must not!
Jupp is completely out of shape! Neither we nor the home country have any understanding for this.
Posipal defends against Austria.
We want to become strong on defense.
Whether that is correct, we will see.
During the nail-biter...against Yugoslavia, didn't you once wish it would finally be over?
How did you feel after the game?
I don't know anything like that.
After the game is before the game.
Bruno, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Packing.
Where do you want to go?
I can't tell you that.
But why do you want to leave?
Oh, come on, you know that.
With me and Dad, it just doesn't work out.
I'm sure it will get better soon.
I want to get out of here anyway, you know?
I finally want to do something useful.
All right. I'm going to Berlin.
To East Berlin.
To the East Zone?
This is the capital of the German Democratic Republic!
There, all people are equal. There are no rich and no poor, no unemployed and freedom of speech!
There's no such thing.
Yes, they do, and from what I've heard, they could use a few more good musicians.
I don't want you to go.
Hey, kid!
You are the best man in the family.
I know that.
And I'm counting on you.
I can do that, can't I?
This one is for dad and mom.
Don't worry, there's nothing bad in it, just the truth. But wait!
I need a week's head start, okay?
You have to promise me that.
Come here.
Huh?
Mr. Lubanski.
Good day, Reverend.
Excuse me, do you have a moment?
But of course. Come.
Who would have thought that?
We are in the semifinals! And a boy from here scored a goal.
Yes.
Is incredible.
In the semifinals, it's against Austria.
Yes, that will be at least as difficult.
Actually, I'm not here to talk about soccer.
Of course not. Sorry.
I just don't know what to do anymore.
Nothing is the way it used to be.
I try to do everything right.
But that only makes things worse.
Now Bruno is gone, too.
I know very many prisoners of war.
Most returnees are ashamed of their time in misery.
They exclude their families, pretend to be strong.
In reality, they are afraid to show what captivity has done to them.
(music)
Didn't you get anything to eat?
Nope.
We have not.
It's like this.
Where we never had enough to eat was....
The Russians had nothing themselves.
We had everything...
devastated and burned.
I was able to grasp with my fingers around my thigh.
(Football commentary on the radio)
The most important thing was to be able to get up in the morning.
Then the first thing you did was touch your comrade next to you to see if he was still warm.
Whether he is still alive.
Maybe his boots could still be used.
At some point, those unable to work were sent home by the Russians.
Many of us wanted to make ourselves sick because we wanted to go home.
They drank salt water...and died from it.
Those who did not yet have dystrophy, who could still walk, they put them in work brigades.
They sent me to Siberia as a specialist in open pit mining.
Haven't you ever thought about home?
I...
I didn't believe in home anymore.
I haven't thought about you anymore.
I only counted the winters...and thought about food.
Every now and then, the farmers would slip us something.
And on the way back, a Russian took me to his home.
He showed me a picture.
With a...black ribbon around it.
It was a picture of his son.
I know I have not always behaved properly toward you.
But...
I just don't know my way around anymore.
It's all so foreign here.
And with Bruno, that had been my fault.
Bruno couldn't stand it here anymore.
He had to replace you for so long.
I think now he just wanted to leave.
He is old enough to make his own decisions.
But here are three others.
They need you.
A gift corner kick for Germany!
Wouldn't surprise me if the 4th goal would fall now.
Fritz Walter shoots with his right foot.
Deflected. Goal. Goal!
Goal for Germany.
Goal for Germany!
Ottmar Walter, Ottmar Walter!
4 1 for Germany.
I am speechless!
(Austrian reporter) So you can see, if you look at the expressions now, as far as you can see them from this distance, that our players are already resigning.
It almost seems... Let's leave it!
Happel has now presented a ball...once again to the Germans.
What's going on today?
Wagner to Probst, Probst forward to Körner 2, who tries a trick.
It fails. Grain 2 to Stojaspal, who hooks away to grain 2...
the one hook once again to Probst.
Probst shoots and hits the grass!
Quite apart from that, Körner 2 and Stojaspal should have shot long ago!
Speed is not witchcraft, as the Germans show us today!
But we are too slow.
Stojaspal on the ball, wants to put Probst in, but he is in Liebrich's hands as if he were a baby...
and the Liebrich his mother.
So, who do we get in the final?
That interests you?
What was that the other day about the 24 people chasing a ball?
Oh, the other day! The other day I was still an ignorant child. So?
Hungary.
They beat Uruguay 4 2 in overtime.
 - Nice gift.
Those wild goal scorers again.
We can hope to lose by only single digits this time.
We're not losing again!
That would not be fair.
Good idea. We just...apply to Fifa for a fair outcome!
All right, wise guy.
I'll tell you something now
 We're winning!
And make shish kebab from the Hungarians.
You mean goulash, honey.
When I say shish kebab, that's what I mean.
Good. What do we bet?
If we ever have kids, I get to pick the names.
If Germany wins.
Otherwise, I'll pick the names.
"And that's why, for me, you are the legitimate successor to Fritz Walter.
Good luck, yours, Carmen Ballmann."
Well?
Carmen Ballmann. Admit it, Horst, you wrote those yourself.
This is a giant soccer expert, there's no doubt about it!
Look at our little ones. I bet we disturbed them at night prayer.
Wasn't that guy there today with the guide dog in the square?
Yes, exactly!
You're not so good at thinking, so I'll say it again slowly 
We're in the final!
Afterwards, you'll be draped in gold and carried off the pitch in sedan chairs!
Yes, and men like me they carve into stone afterwards.
Or in the frying pan, if you don't trip a ball into the goal again soon.
1.
Everyone had a go today, didn't you?
You were just picking your nose!
Come on, Fritz, let's go to Toni's.
He still appreciates real guys.
And I have to pull his ears out for conceding a goal (or: for that 'clean sheet'). 
Sleep well, boys.
In no case eight pieces again.
Otherwise they'll say Turkey was too weak, they were lucky against Yugoslavia, and Austria had a bad day!
You could live with a 4 3.
The ultimate on Sunday would be if it goes into overtime!
But now I've had enough!
Why should we lose at all?
I would love to win, but....
"But...!" I just have to say it :
Take an example from the boss.
He's just talking about how he's going to fill up
the hut full. He's right!
I would like to thank you again for this unscheduled conversation.
We are, after all, unscheduled in the finals.
Is there such a thing as a secret of this German team?
It has a head, a thinker and a leader: Fritz Walter.
Without him, real success would be unthinkable.
If he had been injured early on, we wouldn't be sitting here now.
Herberger! Herberger!
Bravo! Bravo!
Strange! These are the same people you were talking to just two weeks ago....
openly hostile, because you gave the 1st game against us lost from the start.
No, no, I had a strategy that would lead to victory.
Only, unfortunately, it failed particularly miserably.
I don't want to sound presumptuous, Mr. Herberger, but....
Do you actually see a real chance of winning against Hungary?
If the sun shines on Sunday, Hungary will be world champion.
STOPPED HERE
Then we can't stop you.
We are clearly inferior in terms of play.
But what if it rains?
Fritz Walter weather.
Then the ground becomes heavy.
Then... we have a chance.
(music)
Matthias.
Matthias, wake up. Come on, wake up!
What is it?
Get up. We're going for a ride.
What kind of car is that?
I borrowed it from the priest.
(Matthias)
Beautiful.
Where are we going anyway?
To Bern, for the final.
What?
You said yourself :
Only when you're there does the boss win the important games.
(music)
Fucking shit!
We lost the first game against Hungary
with 8 3. That hurt a lot.
But as you all know, everything good and beautiful carries...
already contain the seeds of destruction.
And also vice versa.
8 goals conceded.
What do we learn from this?
The Hungarians are an exceptional team.
Undefeated for 4 years! Except Lorant, Kocsis, Bozsik and Puskas...
there are only players in the team who don't know what it's like to lose with the national team.
But that doesn't mean it can't be done.
Because...
we also scored three goals!
That is, they are vulnerable.
And that is here.
'over on the left. Bozsik plays so offensively that holes always open up behind him.
We have to use this free space!
Hans...
This is especially true for you.
Puskas is back on his feet, but he is playing.
He may be injured, but he'll be eager to play against us.
Werner Liebrich will take care of him.
But if we want to win the final, then we have to hit the Hungarians
in their hearts.
And this is not Puskas.
That's Hidegkuti.
He's nominally a center forward, but he pulls the strings in midfield!
The game runs through him.
He is the one to be eliminated.
Horst! Cling to his heels.
Bite down on him.
I want this man
dream about you tonight!
We have a big tactical advantage.
We know the playing strength of the Hungarians.
Only: They don't know ours.
They don't even know how strong we are!
They don't know that we are strong enough to beat them.
(music)
(music)
Adi! Stoll already times on.
Nothing better than that, Seppl.
(Unintelligible conversations)
Comrades, now the guys have to show whether they are really men!
We lost the war, we are also losing this endgame.
Father!
(engine stutters)
I don't know what's going on either.
I think it's only running on two pots now.
(music)
(Cheers)
(German National Anthem)
(Zimmermann) Germany in the World Cup final, that's a huge sensation!
This is a real soccer miracle, but it came about quite naturally.
We owe it to the soccer intelligence
and the perfection of our players.
And the game here is about to begin.
Therefore, no long introduction, but just the lineup, which Austria with 6 1...
in the final round match
Turek from Düsseldorf in goal, Posipal from Hamburg and Kohlmeyer
from Kaiserslautern in defense.
The runners' row with Eckel and Liebrich
from Kaiserslautern and Mai from Fürth.
In the forward line, Rahn from Essen at right wing, Morlock, Nuremberg, at half right, then the two Walter brothers
from Kaiserslautern and Schäfer from Cologne.
Just now referee Link
from England has just blown the whistle for the match, incidentally the same referee who blew the whistle for the 1st match against Hungary.
What a shit! And so early!
We don't stand a chance anymore.
Why aren't they paying attention back there?
If this continues, it will be without me!
(Carpenter) What we feared has come to pass.
The lightning start of the Hungarians
gave them the lead.
12 0 is the score! And we Germans
are the fools again! That's it!
It was a very stupid mishap.
A silly coincidence.
And still it's 2 0 for Hungary.
If it's a boy, his name is Rüdiger, if it's a girl, Roswitha.
Roswitha?
Roswitha?
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
(Exciting music)
Go, men! Let's go now!
Come on. Nothing is lost yet.
You know, in captivity, I learned a trick.
With the imagination, you know, you can do anything.
We always imagined eating our fill.
And if the hunger
didn't get to us too much, then it worked out wonderfully.
You just have to close your eyes, then you can go anywhere, even to Bern.
It's as if you were there yourself.
Come on, try it.
(Unintelligible)
(Carpenter) Goal! Goal for Germany!
What did I say?
Maybe we can still make it
to the second half, huh?
2 1. Rahn's shot was deflected
by a Hungarian defender!
Maxl Morlock threw himself into the path of the shot.
and with his last strength he pushes the ball past the Hungarian
past the goalkeeper of the Hungarians, Grosics.
Thank God, it is no longer 2 0, it is only 2 1, and that should give our eleven
now give courage and self-confidence.
(Carpenter)
Goal! Goal!
(Mattes)
Goal! Goal! Goal!
(Zimmermann) Goal by Rahn.
The score is 2 2.
The game is even again.
You never play. Morlock stands two or three times all alone in front of the goal, and you slam the thing into the clouds!
You better take care of your defense!
I guess the first two were guest gifts!
We can't iron everything out in front!
Tell that to Kohli. He doesn't even know how to play back to the goalkeeper.
You're stuck on the line!
Are you blind, you secret playmaker?
I'm running my lungs out, and you're just playing to Fritz! - Silence!
Save your breath.
You will need it!
Haven't you realized it yet?
We can become world champions here!
And you're just bickering here.
The score is 2 2!
The Hungarians are furious. In the 2nd half
they'll be all over you again!
So pay attention. You have to burn again
burn for 45 minutes!
Fight. Fight! One for all, all for one! Is that clear?
Pretty exciting, huh?
You can say.
I wanted to apologize to you.
You know, about the rabbits.
Never mind.
I just wanted that for Mom's birthday
something real on the table.
(Zimmermann) We are reporting from Bern.
At the beginning of the 2nd half the score is 2 2.
For Hungary scored Puskas and Ozibor, connecting and equalizing...
for the Germans Morlock and Rahn.
(Whistles from the audience)
(whistle)
(Carpenter) header from Buzanszki
against the crossbar! That was dangerous!
That's as close as we're going to get.
Come on, we'll meet back here. Run!
You have to come with me, Dad.
They can't win without you.
You'll be faster without me. Go!
(Zimmermann) Throw-in Hungary, played forward. Lantos shoots!
Liebrich saves. Another follow-up shot.
Kocsis on the left wing!
Save! Save! Save!
Defense of Turek!
Turek, you are one hell of a guy.
Turek, you are a soccer god!
Please excuse the enthusiasm.
The soccer laymen
will say we are crazy, but remember
today is really
Germany's soccer day, and Hidegkuti's shot, fired from 3 meters full...
on the German goal, is blocked by Turek for a corner!
6 minutes left in the Wankdorf Stadium
in Bern. No one is wavering.
The rain is pelting down! It's heavy, but of course the spectators persevere!
A soccer world cup is every 4 years, and when do you see such a final match
so balanced, so gripping? Foul on Rahn!
(music)
(whistle)
(Player) Allez hopp, Boss!
(Zimmermann) Again and again Bozsik, the right runner of the Hungarians, on the ball.
He lost the ball against Schäfer!
Schäfer crossed to the inside. Header.
Averted!
Rahn should shoot from the background.
Rahn shoots!
Goal! Goal! Goal!
Goal!
3 2 for Germany in the match against Hungary, which for 41/2 years...
has no longer lost an international match!
But the second hand moves so slowly!
I stare across as if spellbound.
Go faster! But he doesn't, he goes ahead with the precision that is prescribed for him.
Now another minute and a half or two minutes.
Germany leads 3 2.
The Hungarians are completely out of their minds!
Puskas on the ball in the center circle.
Now the Hungarians have a chance!
Play off to the right hill. Ozibor.
Now a shot. Held by Toni!
And the 45th minute is completed.
It can only be an aftermath of
one minute, but there is danger!
The Hungarians on the right wing.
Now Fritz Walter has the ball...
hit over the sidelines and out of bounds.
Who can blame him?
Throw-in for Hungary, taken to Bozsik.
(Final whistle)
Off! Off! Off! Off!
The game is over!
Germany is the world champion!
Beats Hungary with 3 2 goals!
(music)
(music)
Ackermann, they're squeezing us to death!
What do you want me to do?
Ahrens said clearly
: I should get on this train!
But I can't keep up.
Why not, Annette?
I can't possibly do that to Dante.
Who is Dante?
But you should really know that.
This is your son.
My son?
Dante?
I get to pick the names.
Already forgotten?
Annette! I'm going crazy. You are...
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
That's what I feel.
Annette.
Annette, you are wonderful.
You know what?
I don't care about this train!
What's the point?
Don't argue. Family comes first.
Besides, you need to take it easy now.
Sorry.
Sorry. Thank you.
Sorry.
(train signal)
Hey, kid, your guy is wanted.
Isn't this place a madhouse?
Sensational!
We are world champions!
Thank you.
Sorry. You are not allowed in here.
I was already on the train the whole time.
I just went to get my boy.
Oh, and who are you?
Ackermann. Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Is he?
Jesus, Mattes. What are you doing here?
I'm going crazy.
Two bottles of beer. And ice cold.
You said you couldn't win the big games
you can't win without me.
That's right. And wasn't I right?
Tell me, are you actually all alone?
No, my father brought me.
Lubanski.
Pleased to meet you. Rahn. Looks like we owe the victory to you.
Yes. Respect for your goal.
I would like to have your nerves.
Go on in, I'll be right back.
I need to have a quick toast with someone, okay?
Boss? Here, just brought me
a real buddy brought me.
Finally, some real beer.
I thought I'd share that with you.
Boss, you will never change.
But if anyone can do it, you can.
Who do we have here?
Fits like a glove. Do you want one?
Toni, come here. Some girls
want your autograph.
- Girls?
Where.
And what do you think of him? Boss, I mean.
He's a great act.
No one can compete with him.
Yes, you do. You can stand up to him.
Wow.
That's a great compliment.
From Bruno. He made me promise not to give it to you earlier.
Dad, what's wrong?
Bruno...
He wishes us all the best and writes that we can visit him anytime.
What must you think of your father?
Sitting here crying like a little child.
You know, I think German boys
can also cry sometimes.
