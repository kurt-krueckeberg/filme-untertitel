# Film Subtitles

## Directions

To download this repository as a **zip** file, click the green **Code** button above.

## Description

The subtitles files used to create the **.txt** and **.html** files (listed in the tables below) were downloaded from the free website [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs), which has [.srt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRT)
subtitle files for many films in multiple languages. The **.srt** files (which are not included in this repository) were stripped of the .SRT time-sequence indicators (and other crap) and converted to text-only files (with the extension **.txt**).
The **.txt** files in turn were used as input (to some simple software I wrote)  to create the **.html** pages.

## To Create .html

```bash
$ create-html.php german-subtitles.txt english-subtitles.txt 
```

OR 

```d
$ ./build german-subtitles.txt english-subtitles.txt bilingual.html
```

Both will output the file output.html.

**Note:** The u.d code works just like the create.html code, except the input files are hard-coded.

### general-style.css

**general-style.css** the stylesheet for bilingual html files found in each subfolder.
